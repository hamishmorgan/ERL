<wiki_text><![CDATA[Folk Songs of the Hills

Folk Songs of the Hills is Merle Travis's classic collection of traditional
songs from his native Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, including original
compositions evoking working life on the railroads and in the coal mines. Each
song, accompanied by Travis on his own acoustic guitar, is introduced by a short
narrative. First issued as a 78 rpm box set album in 1947, this collection has
remained in print in LP and CD reissues up to the present, with additional
tracks from the same period added in later editions (the original album had 8
songs, the most recent edition has 13). This album is widely regarded as one of
Travis' finest achievements. A seminal work in his career, it brought him fame
as an interpreter of traditional American folk music, as a brilliant finger-
style guitarist, and as a folk-inspired composer whose songs "Dark as a Dungeon"
and "Sixteen Tons", included in all editions of this album, have become classics
of folk, country and popular music.

 History

In 1944, Merle Travis moved to Hollywood, California, where he made a living by
acting in minor roles in a few western films and playing with Ray Whitley's
Western Swing Band. At the time, Capitol A & R man and producer Lee Gillette was
looking for a way to enter the rising market for traditional American folk music
created by singers and musicians such as John Jacob Niles, Burl Ives, Josh
White, Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly, and The Golden Gate Quartet. Travis was known
for his broad repertoire of country standards and outstanding guitar playing.
Gillette signed him to a recording contract in 1946 and asked him to record a
series of folk and folk-inspired songs accompanying himself on an acoustic
guitar (although he usually played a hollow-body electric). The recordings that
resulted, taking place at two dates in August 1946, led to the eight titles that
appeared in the original 78 rpm version of Folk Songs of the Hills, one of the
earliest examples of a concept album. Though a commercial flop at the time, the
album was widely admired by musicians, and Travis was invited to preserve some
of his performances in a series of Snader Transcriptions, an early form of music
video, which can be viewed today on several internet sites and DVDs. In 1955,
one song from the album, "Sixteen Tons", was recorded by Tennessee Ernie Ford
and became a million-selling hit. A number of other songs from the album, such
as "Dark as a Dungeon", "John Henry" and "Nine-pound Hammer," entered Travis's
regular repertoire and went on to become folk, country and bluegrass standards.

As the American folk music revival gathered steam in the 1950s, the album was
reissued on LP with a new cover under the title Back Home (Capitol Records
T-891, 1957), adding four more tracks from electrical transcriptions made
earlier by Travis in the same style for radio broadcast. Its first appearance on
CD was as a remastered reissue by Bear Family Records 1993, including all 12
songs in Back Home, where it was coupled with the thematically related 1963
Capitol LP Songs of the Coal Mines. The latest reissue to date is Capitol's own
remastered CD of 1996 (Capitol Vintage 35810), reprising all songs of the
previous reissues as well as a further track dating from the 1940s, "This World
is Not My Home".

 Track listing (1996 Capitol edition)

Only tracks 1-8 appeared on the original 1947 release Folk Songs of the Hills.
Tracks 10-13 were added to the 1957 LP reissue Back Home and the subsequent Bear
Family reissue Folk Songs of the Hills (Back Home/Songs of the Coalmines). Track
9 first appears on the 1996 Capitol reissue.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Tseung Kwan O New Town

Tseung Kwan O New Town (traditional Chinese: 將軍澳新市鎮) is one of the nine new
towns in Hong Kong, mainly built on reclaimed land in the northern half of the
Tseung Kwan O, after which it is named.

 Geography

Although lying within Sai Kung District in the southeastern New Territories, the
new town is often incorrectly regarded as part of Kowloon due to its close
proximity to the city. The total development area of Tseung Kwan O, including
its industrial estate, is about 10.05 km².

 History and urban development

The Hong Kong Government had been interested in developing a new town at Hang
Hau because of its proximity to the urban area. The project was postponed for a
long time owing to the extensive scale of reclamation in the bay, which is
rather deep. It finally started under the name of Tseung Kwan O.

The New Town was developed in three phases. The first phase encompassing
Northern Tseung Kwan O, which includes Po Lam MTR Station and Hang Hau Station,
while the second and third phase encompassing Southern Tseung Kwan O, which
includes Tseung Kwan O Station (Town Centre) and Tiu Keng Leng Station.

The planning of the new town has been centred along the MTR-corridor, with more
than 80% of the population living within 5 minutes of an MTR station, with huge
residential complexes surrounding the MTR stations. As most of the residential
complexes surrounds the MTR station, there are huge parks in the rest of Tseung
Kwan O New Town.

 Population

According to , the population of Tseung Kwan O New Town is around 290,095.

As Tseung Kwan O is not considered a formal entity in the census, the above
population figure takes into account residents of the following breakdown
figures in Sai Kung District which comprise Tseung Kwan O New Town: Hang Hau,
Sheung Tak, Tsui Lam, Hong King, Po Lam, Yan Ying, Wan Hang, King Lam, Hau Tak,
Fu Yu, Tung Ming, On Hong, and Kwon Ming.

The other three census areas in Sai Kung District - namely Sai Kung Central, Pak
Sha Wan, and Sai Kung Islands - are not within the new town.

 Facilities

Tseung Kwan O Hospital is located on Po Ning Lane in the Hang Hau area. A public
sports centre and a library are situated by the roundabout at the end of Tseung
Kwan O Tunnel Road. Tseung Kwan O lacks a performing arts centre.

 Sports

Tseung Kwan O Sports Ground is being built for the 2009 East Asian Games. It
will be completed in early 2009 and will also host Hong Kong First Division
League matches.

 Shopping

Tseung Kwan O has several major shopping complexes:

The largest shopping centre is Metro City (Chinese: 新都城) located by Po Lam MTR
Station. Metro City is divided into three phases and contains most of Hong
Kong's major chains such as Park'n Shop (supermarket) and Fortress (electronics)
in addition to a selection of restaurants ranging from Maxim's Chinese
Restaurant to McDonald's and everything in between.

Hang Hau MTR Station is surrounded by an extensive network of mid-sized shopping
arcades linked by footbridges. The mainstay of this multifarious complex is the
Jusco department store at East Point City (Chinese: 東港城).

Tseung Kwan O Town Centre (Tseung Kwan O MTR Station) is home to Park Central
(Chinese: 將軍澳中心) and Tseung Kwan O Plaza (Chinese: 將軍澳廣場). Both complexes are
very new and relatively underdeveloped with little more than a handful of
restaurants and small shops.

 Industrial estate

Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate is located in the southeast of the town. It is
the site of an MTR depot and TVB City, the headquarters of Hong Kong's largest
television broadcaster. The future mass housing development Dream City will be
built just north of the industrial estate.

Bus routes 797M (NWFB) and 298E (KMB) connect the industrial estate to southern
Tseung Kwan O. A spur line of the MTR's Tseung Kwan O Line is already under
construction and, when completed, will provide easy access to the industrial
estate from Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.

 Transport

 Rail

Tseung Kwan O is served by the MTR metro systems's Tseung Kwan O Line, which
currently has four stations in the new town:

All stations are either connected to or in the proximity of shopping centres and
large private housing developments.

 Bus

The new town is also connected by a well-covered public bus and minibus network.
Hong Kong's three major bus operators all have routes with termini in Tseung
Kwan O:

 Roads

Several main roads lead to Tseung Kwan O:

identified extremely serious environmental health problems with two London
outlets of Chicken Cottage where raw chicken was not kept refrigerated for long
periods and products were used after their use by dates. The programme did
report that the Chicken Cottage headquarters promised to take remedial action
once the BBC had informed them of the problems.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Yes Sir, I Will

Yes Sir, I Will, released by Crass in 1983 (see 1983 in music), was the band's
penultimate 'official' album. The record consists of one continuous piece of
music spread over the two sides of the original vinyl release (the CD release
split the album into 7 tracks), although this is intercut with two brief
interludes; a section of self-parody ("And What if I Told You to Fuck Off?") and
a ballad-style piano section sung by drummer Penny Rimbaud. The album was
essentially a bitter and virulent attack on then prime minister Margaret
Thatcher and her government in the aftermath of the Falklands War, set nearly
wholly over a raging and an almost free-form improvised backing provided by the
groups' instrumentalists. Many of the 'lyrics' of this piece, which can be read
at , are extracted from Rimbaud's extended poem Rocky Eyed. Sleeve notes for the
album include parts of Rimbaud's article The Pig's Head Controversy  that
originally appeared in the Crass produced magazine International Anthem.

The title of the record is ironic, taken from a news cutting reporting a
conversation said to have taken place between Charles, Prince of Wales and a
badly burned soldier (Simon Weston) who had returned from the Falklands;

"Get well soon," the Prince said. And the heroic soldier replied "Yes sir, I
will".

Penny Rimbaud, commenting on this, has said "That was the hook. That was such an
audacious thing to do at the time. Especially given that one had to feel
compassion for Simon Weston."

A film made by Crass member Gee Vaucher to accompany Yes Sir, I Will was shown
at the UK National Film Theatre's Stuff the Jubilee festival of punk films in
2002, and the track has been recently remixed by Penny Rimbaud to incorporate
additional jazz instrumentation provided by Ingrid Laubrock (saxophone) and
Julien Seigal (double bass) to augment the original performance.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Necessary Illusions

Necessary Illusions is a 1989 book by American writer Noam Chomsky about how
political power uses propaganda to distort and distract from real issues to
maintain confusion and complicity, preventing real democracy from becoming
effective. Like many of the titles by Chomsky, such as Pirates and Emperors the
themes come from such titles as St. Augustine's City of God and Public Opinion
by Walter Lippmann, the title of this book borrows a phrase from an earlier
political commentary; in this case, Chomsky quotes from the writings of Reinhold
Niebuhr.

The book is based in Chomsky's 1988 Massey Lectures on CBC Radio in Canada and
extends his propaganda model to a variety of new situations. Appendices address
criticisms of the work and provide additional detail.

As a genre of political thought, parallels exist between Niebuhr's "necessary
illusions" and the "noble lies" of Leo Strauss, "public relations" of Edward
Bernays, and "myth making" of Niccolò Machiavelli. Likewise, Chomsky's analyses
in Necessary Illusions represent a rediscovery of the use of these patterns of
power, Chomsky implies to underscore the failure of populations -- particularly
in a democracy -- to learn from history in this regard.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Hatton School (Wellingborough)

Hatton School is a co-educational comprehensive school in Wellingborough,
Northamptonshire, England named after Sir Christopher Hatton a prominent Tudor
politican and Courtier of Queen Elizabeth I.

 Origin

The school was formed by the amalgamation of Breezehill Girls School and
Westfield Boys School on the Breezehill site. It has a school roll of 1,163 in
2008 of which 137 were in the Sixth Form. It is a Foundation School.

 Historical Background

When the school was founded a suitable name was required to reflect the school’s
aspirations and ambitions, and also identify it with the town and county. Sir
Christopher Hatton had strong connections with Northamptonshire and with
Wellingborough in particular.

Amongst other national positions, he was MP for Higham Ferrers in 1571, MP for
Northamptonshire in 1572, and Lord of the Manor of Wellingborough in 1574).
Hatton was knighted in 1577 and received the Order of the Garter in 1588. A
shrewd businessman, he invested in Frobisher’s ‘Voyages of Discovery’
(1576-1578), in the East India Company and in Drake’s circumnavigation of the
world. Hatton’s heraldic badge was a hind statant d’or’ (Golden Hind), and Drake
renamed his ship, originally The Pelican, out of gratitude to Hatton’s financial
support and friendship. Hatton’s £50 investment became £2300, the kind of
success and enterprise that continued until his death in 1591.

The school aims to enable its students to achieve their potential in life, for
their own benefit and that of the community at large; in effect following in
Hatton's footsteps.

 Ofstead Report 2008

The last Ofstead report was publlished on 16 August 2008. It stated:

"Most students come from the town and surrounding villages.The socio-economic
circumstances of the pupils are very varied, but around the national average
overall. Attainment on entry is around the national average, but the school used
to admit ten per cent of its intake each year based on a test, and some of these
pupils remain in GCSE classes and the sixth form. The proportion of pupils
eligible for free school meals, 11 per cent, is around the national average, as
is that of pupils identified as having special educational needs, 16.5 per cent.
The proportion of those with statements of special need is slightly higher than
average, at four per cent. These are mainly linked to moderate learning
difficulties and social, emotional and behavioural difficulties. Most pupils are
from a white British heritage, although there are about 20 per cent from other
backgrounds, mainly Asian or Caribbean. There are ten pupils whose first
language is not English. The school was awarded a Sportsmark in 2002, and a
Schools’ Achievement Award in 2003".

Ofsteads overall evaluation was that:

"This is a good and improving school, which provides good value for money. The
headteacher provides very good leadership, supported by governors and other key
staff. The school has begun to address most of the issues raised in the last
inspection over the last 15 months. The teachers and management have
successfully taken on a range of initiatives and staff development programmes
that have analysed the school’s weaknesses and, to a large part, remedied them.
There is a positive ethos for learning in the school".

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Steve Rodriguez

Steven James Rodríguez (born November 29, 1970) is a former second
baseman/shortstop in Major League Baseball who played briefly for the Boston Red
Sox and Detroit Tigers during the 1995 season. Listed at 5' 8", 170 lb.,
Rodríguez batted and threw right-handed. A native of Las Vegas, Nevada, he was
selected by Boston in the fifth-round of the 1992 draft out of the Pepperdine
University.

 Baseball career

 College

A two-time Pepperdine Waves All-American (1991-92), Rodríguez helped his team
claim its only national championship in the 1992 College World Series, when he
was named West Conference Player of the Year and also was a member of the All-
Tournament Team, earning Player of the Series honors against Mexico and Cuba.

In 1991, Rodríguez collected a .419 batting average –the third-highest single-
season average in school history–, and his 104 base hits that season are also a
Pepperdine single-season record, as he finished with a .382 average in the
round-robin phase of the 1991 Pan American Games for the Bronze Medal USA
baseball team. Then, in 1992, Rodríguez was named one of the West Coast
Conference's Top Fifty Athletes of all time.

 Major League Baseball

In a 18-game major league career, Rodríguez was a .179 hitter (7-for-39) with
five runs, two doubles, and two stolen bases without home runs or an RBI. He
also played in the Red Sox, Tigers, Dodgers and Expos minor league systems from
1992-98, hitting .263 with 16 home runs and 205 RBI in 613 games.

 Coaching

Following his playing career, Rodríguez served as an assistant coach at his alma
mater from 2000 to 2003, and has been head coach since 2004 to present. He was
hired as the sixteenth head coach in the history of the Pepperdine baseball
program in June 2003, to become only the third former Pepperdine player head
coach for the Waves in the program’s sixty-five-year history.

Taking over a young team in 2004, Rodríguez guided Pepperdine to the WCC
Championship where the Waves swept conference rival Loyola Marymount University
in the best-of-three WCC championship series.

 Personal life

Rodríguez and his wife, Kimberlee, live in Agoura Hills, California. They have
one daughter, Julia, and one son, Nolan.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Sabrina Online

Sabrina Online is a furry slice-of-life webcomic featuring the life of Sabrina
the Skunk and the people around her. The comic was started by Eric W. Schwartz
in 1996 and runs to over 400 individual strips (as of September 2006). It is one
of the oldest continually published webcomics. Sabrina was published in the
Amiga Format magazine. The comic is also being sold in books, with one book for
each year of strips. It has been criticized for its slow rate of updates, with a
mere 3 to 5 three-panel strips produced a month. Schwartz explains that if he
kept to a more productive pace, the resulting time demand would dampen his
enthusiasm for the strip and endanger its continuation.

Sabrina received the Web Cartoonist’s Choice Award for "Best Romantic Comic" in
2001, and was nominated for "Best Anthropomorphic Comic" in 2002, "Outstanding
Anthropomorphic Comic" and "Outstanding Romantic Comic" in 2003 and "Outstanding
Anthropomorphic Comic" in 2004.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Sano Tsuneha

Count Tsuneha Sano (佐野常羽, Sano Tsuneha, 3 July 1871 - 25 January 1956) was an
admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II. He is also noted for his
association with the early Scouting movement in Japan.

 Biography

Sano was born in the Kōjimachi district of Tokyo. His father, Count Sano
Tsunetami, was the founder of the Japanese Red Cross Society.

Sano was a graduate of the 18th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in
1891. He was ranked 20th in a class of 61 cadets. Sano performed his midshipman
training on the Hiei, Musashi, and the cruiser Itsukushima. On commissioning to
sub-lieutenant, he was assigned to the cruisers Naniwa, Matsushima, corvette
Kohei, and the cruisers Saien, Tatsuta. After his promotion to lieutenant in
1897, he was sent to southern China during the height of the Boxer Rebellion of
1900-1901. On his return to Japan, he served on the Izumo and Asama.

On the death of his father on 26 December 1902, he succeeded to the title of
Count (Hakushaku). From 1903-1904, he served as chief gunnery officer on the
Izumi.

Following Sano's promotion to Lieutenant Commander in 1904, he was assigned as
aide-de-camp to Prince Yamashina Kikumaro for the duration of the Russo-Japanese
War. After the war, he served in a number of staff positions, and was assigned
as executive officer to the submarine tender Toyohashi in 1908. Promoted to
commander in 1908, he was appointed naval attaché to Germany from 1911-1914.
While living in Germany, Sano made frequent trips to England, where he became
acquainted with the Scouting movement.

With the outbreak of World War I, Sano returned to Japan to assume command of
the cruiser Tsugaru. In 1917, he became captain of the battleship Haruna. He was
promoted to rear admiral on 1 December 1919. Sano went into the reserves from
August 1920.

In 1924, Japan fielded a full contingent of 25 to the 2nd World Scout Jamboree
in Denmark. Sano was a participant, during which time he attended a Wood Badge
course at Gilwell Park, marking the watershed for the first period of Japanese
Scouting. Sano returned to Japan and created Japan's own training course at Lake
Yamanaka, near the base of Mount Fuji, called Jisshu-sho, for both Cub and Scout
leaders, which is still used to this day, after completion of two preliminary
courses, Koshu-kai and Kenshu-kai.

Sano then attended the 3rd World Scout Jamboree in the United Kingdom, and
received the Silver Wolf award from Baden-Powell in 1931. The only other person
to receive the Silver Wolf in Japan was Emperor Shōwa. Sano was given the title
of "Elder" by the National Scouting Association of Japan in 1954, and was given
the highest award of the NSAJ, the Kijishō, in 1955.

Sano died in 1956.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Bureij

Bureij (Arabic: البريج‎) is a Palestinian refugee camp located in the central
Gaza Strip east of the Salah ad-Din road in the Deir al-Balah Governorate. The
camp's total land area is 529 dunums and in 2005, it had a population of 30,059
registered refugees.

The camp was established in 1949 with a population of 13,000 Palestinians from
the broader Gaza area. A small percentage of the refugees were housed in the
British army barracks but the bulk of them were housed in tents. The UNRWA built
concrete homes in 1950 to replace the tents.

Most of the refugees today like those in most camps in the Gaza Strip today live
in densely populated shelters. The camp does not have a sewage system and most
waste accumalates in the Wadi Gaza, a stream north of the camp and as a result
poses a health hazard. Most of the camp's water comes from an Israeli water
company.

Bureij has six primary and two secondary schools with a population of 9,306
pupils at the end of 2004. All schools are operated by the UNRWA.

On the night of 28 August 1953 bombs were thrown through the windows of huts in
which refugees were sleeping and, as they fled, they were attacked by small arms
and automatic weapons. The casualties were twenty killed, twenty-seven seriously
wounded and thirty-five less seriously wounded. The Mixed Armistice Commission,
in an emergency meeting, adopted by a majority vote a resolution according to
which the attack was made by a group of armed Israelis. Major General Bennike
Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce on Supervision Organization stated
that it was "probable in view of the fact that a quarter of the Israel
complaints during the preceding four weeks referred to infiltration in this
area" that the likely explanation was a "ruthless reprisal raid".

rTorrent is a text-based ncurses BitTorrent client written in C++, based on the
libTorrent libraries for UNIX (which is not the libtorrent library developed by
Arvid Norberg), "with a focus on high performance and good code".

 Technical details

The library differentiates itself from other implementations by transferring
data directly between file pages mapped to memory by the mmap() function and the
network stack. On high-bandwidth connections, it is claimed to be able to seed
at many times the speed of the official client.

rTorrent packages are available for various Linux distributions and Unix-like
systems, and it will compile and run on nearly every POSIX-compliant operating
system, such as FreeBSD.

rTorrent uses ncurses and is suitable for use with screen or dtach. It supports
saving of sessions and allows the user to add and remove torrents. It also
supports partial downloading of multi-file torrents. In the release of
rTorrent-0.7.0 support for BitTorrent protocol encryption is also implemented.
PEX, DHT and initial seeding were recently implemented in rTorrent.

rTorrent can be controlled via XML-RPC over SCGI.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[TechnoMotion

 TechnoMotion is a Korean music video game. As in other games that use dance
pads, such as Dance Dance Revolution, a player must press panels in response to
scrolling arrows on the game's monitor.

 Modes

TechnoMotion has three distinct gameplay modes:

It is possible to change the panel mode between and during songs in the game. A
player has the option to play in Single mode (one player, one pad) or Versus
mode (two players, two pads). There are four difficulty levels: Easy, Normal,
Hard, and Double(one player, both pads). Each difficulty has a separate
songlist, and each pattern is rated with 1 to 12 small diamond icons.

 Music

All but one of the TechnoMotion songs are of the K-Pop music genre.
TechnoMotion's songlist is mostly comprised of new licenses, but there are a few
veteran songs which were found in Pump It Up and Dance Dance Revolution's 3rd
Mix Korean before appearing in TechnoMotion.

TechnoMotion has four different songlists: one for each mode of play.

Easy Mode with 18 songs

Normal Mode with 16 songs

Hard Mode with 16 songs

Double Mode with 20 songs

 Simulation

TechnoMotion's 4-panel and 5-panel modes can be simulated by StepMania, in its
Dance Dance Revolution and Pump It Up modes. An add-on has been released
allowing 8-panel play. It was released as a theme with new arrow skins and
metrics.

 Gameplay

As with most rhythm-based games, TechnoMotion's gameplay consists of scrolling
objects (in this case, arrows) that rise from the bottom of the screen to the
top. When the graphics reach the top, the player must contact buttons on a metal
pad with his feet. To help the player determine when to step on the pad, an area
at the top of the screen has a set of target arrows identical to the scrolling
arrows.

These arrows are arranged in a unique way. Starting from the left:

The pad and the arrows are also color coordinated. The colors are:

Technomotion is also unique among dance games in that many stepcharts have
hidden, or "secret" steps, which do not show up until they are hit. However,
there is a code which can make them appear as normal steps.

 Company

TechnoMotion' was created by the Korean Arcade company F2 Systems. F2 Systems
still exists, though production of TechnoMotion' has stopped. F2 now makes
gambling style arcade games, PC MMORPG games, and standard arcade games. Many of
their Gambling games center around a tropical theme, distinguishing themselves
from other companies.

F2 was founded in 1995, and its first offering was a coin-op "Blank n Holdem."

Their MMO offerings are typical KMMO fare. One centers on a fantasy universe,
another around creating an avatar in an online world to interact with others,
and the final about space exploration.

No mention of TechnoMotion is made on F2's website, aside from an unclickable
graphic on the last page of their games list.

 Versions

There are only 2 editions of TechnoMotion. The first has no subtitle, while the
second is called TechnoMotion The 2nd Dance Floor! Unfortunately, only a handful
of the second batch of cabinets were built.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Indianapolis Fire Department

The Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) is the principal fire suppression,
prevention, and rescue agency of Indianapolis, Indiana, under the jurisdiction
of the Mayor of Indianapolis.

The first fire department in Indianapolis was not founded until June 20 1826. It
was a volunteer department that had to use a church bell for alarms, and had
only ladders and leather buckets to fight fires. This was seventeen months after
the first recorded fire in Indianapolis occurred on January 17 1825, which took
place across the street from the county courthouse in a tavern.

In 1835, a law was passed requiring the purchase of an engine, along with better
equipment, to be partially funded by the state and partially by the city, in
order to protect the Indiana statehouse. From this, the Marion Fire, Hose, and
Protection Company was established. An additional volunteer company was founded
in 1841 and there were eight total volunteer companies in Indianapolis by 1859.
Collectively, 600 men were volunteers in these eight companies, and although
unpaid, they did receive perks such as immunity to be called on juries or
militia duty, and not having to pay poll taxes or taxes for roads.

The volunteer companies were rather political, and tended to express their views
freely. They were also known to break into brothels and freely use their hoses
on the clientele and the interior walls, wrecking the places; not for moral
reasons, but instead to amuse themselves. As a result, the Indianapolis City
Council established a paid force on November 14 1859, so they could have control
over Indianapolis' fire protection, which they did not have over the volunteers.
The Indianapolis Fire Department began with a hook and ladder company and two
hand engines, but would in 1860 gain their first steam engine.

The paid firemen had no days off, were not allowed to leave their post except
for one meal, and were seldom allowed to leave the firehouse unless on fire
business, or a family emergency. An ordinance in 1859 made it illegal to give
firemen alcoholic beverages. Their clothes were irregular; uniforms were not
worn until 1874, with a regulation uniform established in 1928. Firemen would
have to buy their own uniforms until 1943, when a $60 clothing allowance was
established. An attempt to remove politics from the fire department was not very
successful; it was necessary to mandate that the department staff be half
Republican and half Democrat, and the role of fire chief was based on political
affiliation and family contacts.

The first dog to discover arson for the Indianapolis Fire Department was in July
1993.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Forever Changes

Forever Changes is the third album released by the Los Angeles-based band Love.
The album was released by Elektra Records in November 1967.

 Album information

Dropping keyboardist Alban Pfisterer and flautist/saxophonist Tjay Cantrelli,
the remaining five-piece performed on nine of the album's eleven tracks. The
album was the first to be produced by Arthur Lee, with assistance from Bruce
Botnick.

Originally, the album was to be produced by Botnick and Neil Young, but Young
bowed out due to his commitments to Buffalo Springfield. However, according to
the liner notes of the 1995 compilation Love Story, Young did stick with the
album project long enough to arrange the track "The Daily Planet".

The sessions began in June 1967, with the group (except for Lee and Maclean)
replaced by well-known Los Angeles session musicians Billy Strange (guitar), Don
Randi (piano), Hal Blaine (drums) and, in most likelihood, Carol Kaye (bass).
This studio line-up was put in place due to the regular line-up's alleged
inability to function. The two tracks laid down, "Andmoreagain" and "The Daily
Planet", were later given sparing overdubs by the actual members of Love, who
felt the tracks otherwise sufficed.

Botnick recalls that the use of session musicians "sparked" the band, and they
"realized they had blown it, got their act together and recorded the rest of the
album". After much rehearsal, the group resumed work in August and continued
through September, quickly laying down the remaining nine tracks, with a total
estimated cost at $2,257. Rooted in acoustics, the album's lyrics were a perfect
summation of the year 1967, at times joyous, at times contemplative, at times
downright devastating.

"When I did that album," commented Arthur Lee, "I thought I was going to die at
that particular time, so those were my last words." This is borne out by perhaps
the most famous lines from the album, on the song "The Red Telephone":

Musically, the album is very ambitious. Having extended itself on the lengthy
jam "Revelation" from Da Capo, Love here composes a more focused mini-suite, the
album-ending "You Set the Scene", which anticipated the extended rock operas
that would dominate rock and roll in the following years.

A September recording session finished the album, sweetening the final mixes
with horns and strings (arranged by David Angel with each song's respective
songwriter), as well as some additional piano from Randi, who played all the
keyboard parts on the album as the band now had no keyboard player.

The album was released in November with cover art by Bob Pepper and disappeared,
rising to a lowly #154 on the Billboard charts. It did however reach the Top 30
in Britain. Only well after the group's break-up would the album be recognized
as a masterpiece by the rock journalism press.

Forever Changes was included in its entirety on the 2-CD retrospective Love
compilation Love Story 1966-1972, released by Rhino Records in 1995. The album
was re-released in an expanded single-CD version by Rhino in 2001, featuring
alternate mixes, outtakes and the group's 1968 single, "Your Mind and We Belong
Together"/"Laughing Stock", the last tracks featuring Johnny Echols, Ken Forssi,
Michael Stuart and, in most likelihood, Bryan MacLean. As for Arthur Lee, he
would reform the group in late 1968 with all-new members and carry on the Love
name for a few more years.

A double-CD "Collector's Edition" of the album was issued by Rhino Records on
April 22, 2008. The first disc consists of the original 1967 album, while the
second disc is an alternate mix of it plus the 2001 release bonus songs.

 Reception

The most notable retrospective praise came in 2003 from the British magazine,
NME, who rated Forever Changes #6 on their list of greatest albums of all time.
In 1998 Q magazine readers voted Forever Changes the 82nd greatest album of all
time. In  it comes in at #69. Rolling Stone magazine ranked Forever Changes 40th
in its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in the December 11, 2003
issue. In a special issue of Mojo magazine, it was ranked the second greatest
psychedelic album of all time, while in 1995 it made #11 in Mojo's list of the
100 Greatest Albums Ever Made. Forever Changes was ranked 83rd in a 2005 survey
held by British television's Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of
all time.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[It's Raining

"It’s Raining" was the first single off the highly-anticipated third album from
the Korean R&B singer, Rain.

"It’s Raining" first hit airwaves in September 2004 (a month before the album,
It’s Raining), and was met with a positive response. The single went straight to
the number one position in South Korea. The single and its album launched Rain
as an international artist throughout Asia in 2005. Both reached number one in
several places, including Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, China, Shanghai, and Hong
Kong.

With this single, Rain presented a brand-new image to his fans, and explored a
more upbeat, hip-hop influenced sound. In an attempt to attract a larger
international audience, he changed his name from Bi (meaning ‘rain’ in Korean)
to its English form, Rain. This was also Rain's first single with an English
name, rather than a Korean one. The single eventually made its way to the MTV
studios in 2006. Its video was played periodically on MTV (USA) to promote
Rain’s first ever US concert, Rainy Day, in Madison Square Garden. It is rumored
that an English version of the song will be re-recorded for inclusion on Rain’s
first English album, due in 2008.

 Music video

In the music video for It’s Raining, Rain is delivered to a night club for a
live performance by his entourage, bringing some life to the previously dull
atmosphere. Towards the end of the song, rain starts to pour from the ceiling.
Parts of the video appear to have been shot in front of fans. On the music
video, instead of the woman saying "Rain, Go Rain!, It's Raining, It's Raining",
you would hear Rain saying the side verse.

 Korean Promo Single

A commercial single of It’s Raining was never released. However, promos were
sent out to TV and radio stations containing one track, It's Raining [Radio
Edit].

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Ganglia (software)

Ganglia is a scalable distributed monitoring system for high-performance
computing systems such as clusters and grids. It allows the user to remotely
view live or historical statistics (such as CPU load averages or network
utilization) for all machines that are being monitored.

 Ganglia

It is based on a hierarchical design targeted at federations of clusters. It
relies on a multicast-based listen/announce protocol to monitor state within
clusters and uses a tree of point-to-point connections amongst representative
cluster nodes to federate clusters and aggregate their state. It leverages
widely used technologies such as XML for data representation, XDR for compact,
portable data transport, and RRDtool for data storage and visualization. It uses
carefully engineered data structures and algorithms to achieve very low per-node
overheads and high concurrency. The implementation is robust, has been ported to
an extensive set of operating systems and processor architectures, and is
currently in use on over 500 clusters around the world. It has been used to link
clusters across university campuses and around the world and can scale to handle
clusters with 2000 nodes.

The ganglia system comprises two unique daemons, a PHP-based web front-end, and
a few other small utility programs.

 Ganglia Monitoring Daemon (gmond)

Gmond is a multi-threaded daemon which runs on each cluster node you want to
monitor. Installation is easy. You don't have to have a common NFS filesystem or
a database back-end, install special accounts, maintain configuration files or
other annoying hassles.

Gmond has four main responsibilities:

Each gmond transmits in information in two different ways:

 Ganglia Meta Daemon (gmetad)

Federation in Ganglia is achieved using a tree of point-to-point connections
amongst representative cluster nodes to aggregate the state of multiple
clusters. At each node in the tree, a Ganglia Meta Daemon (gmetad) periodically
polls a collection of child data sources, parses the collected XML, saves all
numeric, volatile metrics to round-robin databases and exports the aggregated
XML over a TCP sockets to clients. Data sources may be either gmond daemons,
representing specific clusters, or other gmetad daemons, representing sets of
clusters. Data sources use source IP addresses for access control and can be
specified using multiple IP addresses for failover. The latter capability is
natural for aggregating data from clusters since each gmond daemon contains the
entire state of its cluster.

 Ganglia PHP Web Front-end

The Ganglia web front-end provides a view of the gathered information via real-
time dynamic web pages. Most importantly, it displays Ganglia data in a
meaningful way for system administrators and computer users. Although the web
front-end to ganglia started as a simple HTML view of the XML tree, it has
evolved into a system that keeps a colorful history of all collected data.

The Ganglia web front-end caters to system administrators and users. For
example, one can view the CPU utilization over the past hour, day, week, month,
or year. The web front-end shows similar graphs for memory usage, disk usage,
network statistics, number of running processes, and all other Ganglia metrics.

The web front-end depends on the existence of the gmetad which provides it with
data from several Ganglia sources. Specifically, the web front-end will open the
local port 8651 (by default) and expects to receive a Ganglia XML tree. The web
pages themselves are highly dynamic; any change to the Ganglia data appears
immediately on the site. This behavior leads to a very responsive site, but
requires that the full XML tree be parsed on every page access. Therefore, the
Ganglia web front-end should run on a fairly powerful, dedicated machine if it
presents a large amount of data.

The Ganglia web front-end is written in the PHP scripting language, and uses
graphs generated by gmetad to display history information. It has been tested on
many flavours of Unix (primarily Linux) with the Apache webserver and the PHP
4.1 module.

Oud-Turnhout is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Antwerp. The
municipality only comprises the town of Oud-Turnhout proper. On January 1 2006
Oud-Turnhout had a total population of 12,653. The total area is 38.80 km² which
gives a population density of 326 inhabitants per km².

There are 3 parishes : "Zwaneven" in the east, "St Bavo" in the centre, and
"Oosthoven" in the north. "Zwaneven" is in the upmarket residential area
referred to as "De Lint", where many Dutch people settled down, fleeing high
taxes and strict building regulations in The Netherlands. Houses here are easily
priced 750.000 € and over.

 Economy

Apple farms, pig farms and local shops are the main economic activity. Most
inhabitants commute to nearby Turnhout for work, school, culture etc.

 Seesights

In the northern part of the village "The Liereman" is one of Flanders' largest
nature reserves.

In the southern part "Priorij Corsendonck" is a 15th century abbey, rebuild and
renovated several times, and now in use as a conference centre. It is not open
to the general public.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Warm Springs Elementary School

Warm Springs Elementary School is a public elementary school in Fremont,
California. It serves students in from kindergarten through the sixth grade and
is one of 28 elementary schools in the city belonging to the Fremont Unified
School District (FUSD). Warm Springs is part of the Irvington Attendance area,
and goes to Irvington High School and Horner Junior High School.

 History

Warm Springs School is unique in that it is the only grade 3-6 elementary school
in the Fremont Unified School District. Our sister school, serving grades K-2,
is James Leitch School on Fernald Ave. Together, it is one of the largest K-6
elementary schools in FUSD district, serving over 1000 students.

The original Warm Springs School main building was built in 1936 and stands very
historically statuesque on Warm Springs Boulevard. We have recently completed
modernization projects such as classroom upgrades, a new library, computer lab
and science lab. Our spacious campus allows us the luxury of two large
playgrounds and two outdoor eating areas for our students. The east end of our
campus connects with Warm Springs Little League Ball Park and provides a
beautiful view of the Mission Hills. Many of the local businesses serve as
Partners in Education by providing career education and donations to our school.

More In-Depth History of Warm Springs School The first school in the Warm
Springs area opened in 1863 in a shed, 12 feet by 14 feet, located on the Wilson
property. Elizabeth F. Valpey taught 15 pupils there for three months in order
to organize a district. The Higuera School District was established and named in
the honor of the Higuera family, the most prominent Spanish name in the Warm
Springs area.

Ygnacio Anastacio Higuera came to California with the de Anza Expedition of
1776. Jose Higuera was appointed Mayordomo of Mission San Jose in 1822 and was
the grantee of Las Tularcitos Ranch in the Milpitas area. In 1836 his son,
Fulgencio Higuera, was granted Rancho Agua Caliente. The term ”agua caliente”
means warm water in Spanish.

The First Warm Springs School House, 1864 In 1864, a small schoolhouse was built
across Warm Springs Boulevard from the present school. The name was changed to
Warm Spring School District in 1866, and the "s" was added later to form Warm
Springs. The name is taken from the real warm springs that flow from the
hillside at the present Hidden Valley Ranch on Stanford Avenue. The building was
remodeled in 1879. The report of the Alameda county superintendent in 1877 noted
that the school did not have "sufficient grounds."

The teacher in 1879 reported that she was using McGuffey's readers but admitted
that she didn't always stick to the course of study. She commented, "you who are
an old teacher will understand how hard it is to do justice to all in an
ungraded school. I am aware that I have no authority to use the word book but it
is the wish of the patrons of the school that their children learn to spell
correctly.”

The Second School, 1889 A new building was constructed in 1889 on Warm Springs
Boulevard across from the old building. It was a commodious school building from
the old building that cost $6,000 and was located about eight feet behind the
building of today. The old building was sold to the Christian Church and later
burned.

May Davis came to teach in 1913. Her students included Rose Vargas and her
daughter Evelyn Brown. Miss Davis stayed long enough to teach "the third
generation."

Mr. Brown's daughter, Evelyn, was one of the students at Warm Springs School.
She later graduated from Washington Union High School and served a secretary to
the district superintendents at both Washington and Fremont Unified School
Districts.

Leslie Maffey served as a teacher and principal until 1944. His wife, Eva also
taught here from 1927 to 1944. Joe Brown was a trustee from 1918 to 1929 and
sometimes board meetings were held in his Warm Springs grocery store.

Trustees wrestled with the problem of maintaining the old building. One August
meeting they faced the questions of "fixing the fence, covering the toilet with
shingles, putting a door on the tank house, cleaning it and the yard, and fixing
window jambs." The question of a new school came up but they decided this was
not the proper time because the "residents were very busy" with the prune
harvest.

They called for a bond election in 1930 but it failed, and building plans were
postponed again. The depression was hurting everyone and salaries had to be
reduced in 1932 "on account of the shortage of funds." They had to be reduced
again the next year. The trustees called a meeting to hear what the taxpayers
had to say concerning the budget. The trustees met and waited but "nobody showed
up."

1936 In 1936, the present building was erected in front of the old 1889
schoolhouse. The enrollment ranged between 70 and 90, then established around
100 except during the spring pea harvest of the 1930s and '40's. When the
Mexican families moved in to harvest the peas the enrollment spurted up to as
high as 165.

A cafeteria was started in 1952 and Edna Treleavere was the cook. The children
ate in the room that is now used as the library.

1953 In 1953, the staff was increased to four teachers when Mrs. Appel was hired
to teach third grade in the upstairs room. Francis Trembley became principal in
1955. At that time, a band was organized.

James Sullivan became principal in 1959. Because of the growth that began in the
late 1950s, Joe Bettencourt's walnut orchard was pulled out to make way for two
new classroom wings and the playground.

1960 In 1960, two subdivisions were developed. The enrollment shot up to over
600 students. Portables were added in 1961. Mr. Sullivan was made principal-
superintendent in 1962. A kindergarten began and a teacher was hired for each
grade. There were four separate additions beginning with a kitchen, portable
classrooms, and three wings. The school expanded seven times its size in four
years.

1963 By 1963, the district had grown to 29 teachers. The 662 students were on
double session. Mr. Sullivan was made full time superintendent, and the Board of
Trustees decided to build a new school on Warren Avenue to be named James Leitch
in honor of the Leitch family. Because of the need for space, the Warm Springs
district offices were housed in a tract home bought by the district for that
purpose. It was sold after unification.

Warm Springs merged with the other districts to form the Fremont Unified School
District in 1964 and Al Semenza became principal. James Howden became principal
in 1969, and upon his death in 1973, Howard Johnson became the school's 29th
principal.

The Warm Springs School Mascot The mascot also has a history. It has been
changed from the "raiders" to "warriors" to the current mascot, the "wolves."

Present Day The school has added several classrooms to accommodate the 20 to 1
ratio in the third grade. The Science and Computer Labs and Library were
modernized.

Source of History This history of the school was written in a documentary called
“Reflections - The Educational Heritage of Fremont”, compiled and edited by
Philip Holmes and Dolores Rose.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[The Funhouse

The Funhouse is a 1981 slasher film directed by Tobe Hooper and written by Larry
Block. The original music score is composed by John Beal. The story went out of
its way to subtly portray the antagonist as someone to be pitied and not just
feared (since most critics have pointed out that He tended to only kill out of
pain!)

 Synopsis

Against her father's orders, Amy goes to a sleazy traveling carnival with her
new boyfriend Buzz, her best friend Liz, and Liz's boyfriend Richie. Unbeknownst
to the four teens, Amy's prank-happy little brother Joey (who happens to be
obsessed with classic horror movies) sneaks out of the house and follows them to
the carnival. Amy's father is opposed to her going to the carnival because a
couple of Girl Scouts were found murdered at its previous set-up. No one knows
who killed the two children, and both girls had to be identified using dental
records.

At the carnival, the four teens smoke marijuana and sneak into a 21-and-over
striptease joint. They heckle Madame Zena the Fortune Teller, visit a freaks-of-
nature exhibit, and view a magic show.

Finally, the foursome telephone their parents and lie to them, so they can spend
the night in the carnival's funhouse - actually a darkride - after it closes.
While Joey waits for them to emerge, the teenagers enjoy a sexual romp in the
dark funhouse. Then they notice the Funhouse Barker's assistant - a huge man in
a Frankenstein suit who never speaks - making out with a lingerie-clad Madame
Zena. She demands a hundred dollars from "Frankenstein," and when he ejaculates
prematurely, she refuses to "go all the way" as agreed. When she won't give back
the money, "Frankenstein" attacks and strangles her.

After witnessing this incident, the four teenagers attempt to leave the
funhouse, but find that it is locked. Richie, who suggested spending the night
in the funhouse to begin with, adds insult to injury by cleaning out the steel
strongbox from which "Frankenstein" retrieved one hundred dollars for Madame
Zena's pay. The kids have to hide again when the Funhouse Barker, Conrad
Straker, returns and sees what "Frankenstein" - actually his son Gunther - has
done to Madame Zena. After giving Gunther a violent reprimanding, Conrad decides
that they'll deposit Madame Zena's body to make it look as though she was killed
by "the locals". Then Conrad discovers that all of the money from his strongbox
is missing. At first, he jumps to the obvious conclusion that Gunther has taken
it, and tortures Gunther until the latter rips off his Frankenstein mask.

To the teens' shock, Gunther is gruesomely deformed: head and nose twice as wide
as they should be; with oversized mouth, huge sharp protruding teeth, and ruby-
red eyes. At this startling revelation, Richie accidentally drops his cigarette
lighter through the vent where it lands on the floor by Conrad and Gunther.
Conrad promptly discovers the lighter, and realizes he and Gunther are not
alone. Even worse, it is likely that whoever dropped this lighter also witnessed
Gunther's killing of Madame Zena. This witness (or witnesses) will have to be
found, slain and buried as surreptitiously as possible. It won't be the first
time, either: Conrad and Gunther had to murder a pair of Girl Scouts for
tripping over their secret; had word gotten out, Gunther would have been lynched
and butchered (like his mother), or put on display in the freak exhibition (like
his late younger brother Tad).

After killing Richie with a hangman's noose, actually a funhouse prop, Gunther
captures Liz with a trapdoor Liz tries to lure Gunther into a trap with promises
of sex, but when she stabs Gunther he attacks her, stabbing her to death with
his sharpened finger nails. Conrad tries to shoot Amy, but Buzz jumps him for
his pistol. It fires, killing Conrad. Then Gunther attacks Buzz for the gun,
while Amy runs for it. The pistol goes off again, this time killing Buzz.

Gunther chases Amy into a room filled with hydraulic machinery, huge sprockets,
and the like. He tries to knock her head in with a crowbar, but misses and hits
the fusebox instead... electrocuting, but somehow not killing, him. Caught
between the two primary gears, he attempts to drag her between them with him.
She tears herself free as he is crushed to death.

At dawn, Amy exits the funhouse. An animated fat lady laughs uproariously as Amy
- her clothes ripped, her makeup running, her shoes gone - proceeds to walk
home.

 Novelization

A novelization of the screenplay was written by Dean Koontz, under the pseudonym
Owen West. As the film production took longer than expected, the book was
released before the film.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Royce Simmons

Royce Simmons (born 2 May, 1960 in Gooloogong, New South Wales) is an Australian
former professional rugby league test hooker, New South Wales representative,
long-serving Penrith Panthers player in the New South Wales Rugby League
premiership, and coach.

 Biography

 Playing career

After trialling with both St. George and Souths, Simmons was eventually given a
contract in 1980 with Penrith. Simmons played much of his first year at lock but
was moved to hooker late in the 1981 season.

In 1983, Simmons was appointed captain of the team, a position he retained until
1990 when he captained the Panthers in the 1990 Grand Final loss to the Canberra
Raiders, and despite struggling with injuries, memorably scored two tries in the
1991 Grand Final against the same opponents. The Panthers won their first
premiership, and Simmons retired.

 Representative career

Simmons was first selected to represent New South Wales as a hooker for games II
and III of the 1984 State of Origin series, replacing Rex Wright who had been
chosen for game I.

A successful 1986 series against Queensland, including a Man of the Match in
game I, secured Simmons a place as the first Penrith player to represent
Australia. He made his debut against New Zealand in July 1986 and played in ten
international games over the next year. Simmons' final test appearance came in
Australia at Lang Park against New Zealand, losing 6–13.

Simmons was selected for all games of the 1987 State of Origin series, including
the fourth game held in Philadelphia. His last appearance in a New South Wales
jersey was in game I of the 1988 series, losing 18–26.

 Coaching career

Simmons went on to become Panthers coach in the closing stages of the 1994
season after Phil Gould was dismissed, and served until he was himself sacked
from the position after the 2001 season, when the Panthers won the wooden spoon.
The Panthers made the finals twice under Simmons' tenure, in the 1997 Super
League finals and National Rugby League season 2000 finals.

Since 2003, Simmons has served as the assistant coach at the Wests Tigers under
his former coach Tim Sheens.Huddersfield giants seem the likely club to sign him
back as a 1st team coach.

In October 2004, Simmons was named at hooker in the Panthers' Team of Legends.

Orbert Davis is an American jazz trumpeter and bandleader.

 Biography

Davis was born in Chicago and raised in Momence, Illinois. He began playing

Northwestern University.

In addition to recording over 3000 TV and radio commercials, Davis has released

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Mike Vasas

Michael Robert Vasas (born February 17, 1982 in Dearborn, Michigan, United
States) is an American singer, multi-instrumentalist, composer, and music
educator. He is the founder of the musical collective Grammy Hall Records, and a
member of the free improvisation group; The Early Minor Quintet.

 Early career

A singer, piano player and guitarist, Vasas attended Edsel Ford High School in
Dearborn, MI. His first songwriting and recording was with high school friend
and guitarist Matt Mepham. They released an EP and a full length under the band
name Pendulum. The duo also scored a theatrical production of Lewis Carroll’s
Alice in Wonderland in 1999.

After high school, Vasas attended Kalamazoo College in Kalamazoo, Michigan
studying music. His first solo record, The Lessons We Have Learned, was released
in 2001 and featured mostly folk-oriented pop songs. That year, Vasas also
composed music for a college production of Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead and reunited with Mepham, releasing 451—a progressive rock
record based on Ray Bradbury’s book Fahrenheit 451. Additionally, Vasas released
July Songs, a collection of electropop instrumentals recorded during a week of
mixing of the 451 album.

In 2002, he formed the musical-comedy duo with David Poytinger, releasing a live
2-disc set in May of that year. Mike and Dave attracted fans because of its
original music, short films, and strange advertisements, which included then-
president James F. Jones being rescued by the duo in the president’s office
during a staged heart attack.

Vasas remained busy—independently releasing a live rock record and four more
solo records up until 2004. Typically diverse in style, the genres of these
records included folk-rock (Bad Luck), folk (Collection on Desktops), rock (The
City) and baroque pop (Grace Monica).

In 2004, Vasas began work on his Masters degree in music education at Michigan
State University. In 2005, he released an ambient instrumental record and two of
his songs were featured in a Los Angeles performance piece Epiphany. It was then
he began work with The Beasts of Burden.

 Mike Vasas and The Beasts of Burden

The original 2005 group consisted of Vasas and current MSU students. The band’s
name was meant to reference songwriter-led acts like Elvis Costello and The
Attractions, Johnny Cash and The Tennessee Three, and Tom Petty and The
Heartbreakers. With members graduating, the original group folded quickly after
the end of the school year.

In May 2005, Vasas reformed the group with Ryan Malinich (drums), Brian Richard
(bass), and Brian Slagle (guitar, keyboards) playing its first gig at the Ann
Arbor Art Fair. Keyboardist, harmonica and mandolin player Eric Bredin joined
the group soon afterwards. Vasas released the Rescue Team/Makeshift EP in
October 2005, and also co-organized a Neil Young Tribute show that benefitted
both The Bridge School and a local domestic abuse shelter in Lansing, Michigan.
In February 2006, Vasas celebrated his 24th birthday, performing with The Beasts
of Burden, and sharing the bill with Chicago’s new-wave act, the Detholz! and
Detroit’s powerpop trio, The Singles.

In July 2006, Mike Vasas and The Beasts of Burden was released to positive
national acclaim       and the band lightly performed in support of the record.
Line up changes led to Mepham taking over guitar duties and the current band
remains a four-piece.

In March 2008, Vasas and The Beasts performed at The Palace of Auburn Hills with
Creedence Clearwater Revisited and have since been focusing on recording a
follow up to their 2006 release. On his website, Vasas described the new record
as sounding like “rock-oriented pop songs, built with our own brand of goofy
misperceptions and sonic shenanigans."

 The Early Minor Quintet

Vasas is also a member of the free improvisation multi-instrumentalist ensemble,
The Early Minor Quintet. Named after sessions from Miles Davis’s In a Silent
Way, the group’s Myspace page describes them as;

"musique concrète du jazz..." We freely improvise rock, jazz, funk, noise, and
"classical" sounds and reconstitute the music through editing and splicing. Some
of the record consists of segments of improvisation unedited. No need to tell
you which is which.

The group includes Vasas, Nate Bliton, David Menzo, Max Monson, and Dustin
Stoner. Although an album’s worth of material is supposedly recorded, and the
Myspace band page states “Record Coming Soon on Grammy Hall Records, there is
some question as to whether the group is active or not. The ensemble has done a
few live performances, but little activity has occurred, and the Myspace page
shows the last login as April 2007.

 Grammy Hall Records

Vasas formed Grammy Hall Records to be a record music collective rather than a
true business venture. It was involved with the original EP of indie-folk group
Frontier Ruckus, whom later signed to Quite Scientific Records. According to the
Grammy Hall Records website, the label:

“releases music that is best described as 'I don't know, just music' rather than
specific genres. When you buy a record with the GRHL number, it has been
supported through the artistic process to be what it wants rather than what it
should be. For the listener, this translates to a “diversity” in releases
unified only by the collective's commitment to quality. We are a listener's
label.”



 The Found Sound Series

In 2008, Vasas began releasing records under the Found Sound Series name. The
music is unlike most of Vasas’s previous releases, having much in common with
composers like Iannis Xenakis and Karlheinz Stockhausen, focusing on
electroacoustic music manipulation of samples. Additionally, the releases are
composed/performed in a modular recording environment called Bidule. The first
five records were released on Vasas’s website for free, each offering the chance
to donate money if the listener so chooses.

Typical of the series, one recording focuses on the manipulation of four source
recordings of street musicians in Germany, recorded by ex-Beasts’ guitarist
Brian Slagle. The four tracks each only feature a single short corresponding
source recording.

 Discography

 Personal

Vasas lives with his wife, Amanda, in Lansing, Michigan. He is a music teacher
in Battle Creek , Michigan where he teaches middle school and kindergarten
general music and choir.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Lake Pukaki

Lake Pukaki is a lake in New Zealand's South Island. It is the second-largest of
three roughly parallel alpine lakes running north-south along the northern edge
of the Mackenzie Basin (the others are Lakes Tekapo and Ohau). All three lakes
were created by receding glaciers blocking their respective valleys with their
terminal moraine (a moraine-dammed lake). The glacial feed to the lakes gives
them a distinctive blue colour, created by glacial flour (extremely finely
ground rock particles from the glaciers). It covers an area of 169 km², and the
normal operating range lake level is 518.2 to 532 metres above sea level.

The lake is fed at its northern end by the braided Tasman River, which has its
source in the Tasman and Hooker Glaciers, close to Aoraki/Mount Cook. Good views
of the mountain, 70 kilometres to the north, can be had from the southern shore
of the lake.

The lake's original outflow was at its southern end, into the Pukaki River. The
lake is now, however, an upper part of the Waitaki hydroelectric scheme. As a
result, the outflow has been dammed, and the water flows out through a canal
linking it to a canal carrying water from Lake Ohau, from which it travels
through through the Ohau A power tastion to Lake Ruataniwha. Pukaki is also fed
by the waters of Lake Tekapo, which are diverted through a canal to a power
station on Pukaki's eastern shore (Tekapo B station). The lake has been raised
twice to increase storage capacity (9m in the 1940s, 37m in the 1970s),
submerging Five Pound Note Island, which once appeared on New Zealand's five
pound note. The current lake has an operating range of 13.8 m (the level within
which it can be artificially raised or lowered), giving it an energy storage
capacity of 1,595 GWh). Along with Lake Tekapo's 770 GWh storage, it provides
over half New Zealand's hydroelectricity storage capacity.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Battle for the Planet of the Apes

Battle for the Planet of the Apes is a 1973 science fiction film and is the
fifth and final entry in the Planet of the Apes series. It was directed by J.
Lee Thompson. Considered by critics to be the weakest of all the sequels, the
film's budget was also the lowest.

 Plot

This synopsis is based on the expanded European version, later seen on network
television.

Set in flashback to the turn of the 21st century, and told by the Great
Lawgiver, this sequel focuses on the ape leader, Caesar (Roddy McDowall), a few
decades after he led the ape revolution in the previous film, Conquest of the
Planet of the Apes. In this post-nuclear war society, Caesar tries to cultivate
peace between his simian peers and the surviving remains of humanity. Gorilla
leader Aldo (Claude Akins), however, wants nothing to do with this; therefore he
plots Caesar's overthrow and doom. Caesar is now married to Lisa, the female ape
of the previous film, and they have a son, named Cornelius in honor of Caesar's
father. Caesar regrets having never known his parents, until his human
assistant, MacDonald, informs him that by viewing taped archives of his parents,
he can learn of the future. Caesar learns the archives are in the Forbidden
City, once a large Human city, and is now nuclear ruins. Caesar travels with
MacDonald and Virgil to the Forbidden City and sneaks in to find the record
archives. However, there are radiation-scarred humans still living in the
Forbidden City, now under the command of Governor Kolp. Caesar and his party
view the recordings of Cornelius and Zira and learn of the future of the world,
but barely have enough time to study the tapes before they must escape or risk
capture and death. Kolp considers this clandestine entrance by Caesar an act of
espionage while his subordinate Méndez says that they did nothing wrong and
should be allowed to go in peace. Governor Kolp then declares war on Ape City,
mustering the humans from the Forbidden City to destroy the ape society once and
for all.

Meanwhile, Aldo is furious over the fact that Caesar wants to co-exist
peacefully with humans, and plots a military coup in order to install himself as
the leader of Ape City. Cornelius, while climbing a tree, overhears this, but is
spotted by Aldo, who hacks at the branch, causing Cornelius to suffer serious
injuries and remain bedridden. Cornelius eventually dies in the arms of his
parents. Caesar is devastated by this event, and only leaves the side of his
now-dead son when he learns Kolp's ragtag force is attacking Ape City. Aldo
leads the gorillas to break in to the armory, steal the weapons and corral all
the humans into a pen, under the justification that all humans are alike and
should be locked away.

The mutants attack Ape City and initially succeed. When Kolp finds Caesar, he
taunts him, saying the apes would once again be humanity's slaves. But when Lisa
cries out, Caesar is spurred on. He shouts NOW, FIGHT LIKE APES!!!, and the apes
launch a counter-attack that ultimately drives the mutants off. Kolp and his
remaining forces are killed by Aldo and his troops. After the battle, Aldo wants
to kill the humans in the pen, but Caesar shields them. It is then revealed that
Cornelius' death was not due to an accident, but Aldo's malevolence. The ape
community concludes that the society's sacred law ("ape must never kill ape")
has been broken. As the community repeats "ape has killed ape", an infuriated
Caesar engages in a single combat with Aldo, which results in Aldo's death.
Caesar then frees the humans, who insist that freedom is meaningless without
being treated as equals. Caesar then realizes the apes are just as despicable as
the slaveowners who once owned them if they treat the humans as second class
citizens. The apes and humans then decide to coexist with one another and begin
to make a new society.

Back in the Forbidden City, Méndez has succeeded Kolp as Governor. A mutant is
about to fire the cobalt bomb, when Governor Méndez countermands Kolp's last
order, saying that it will result in massive destruction and a Pyrrhic victory,
whereas if they form a respect, even religion, based on the bomb, they will
always have a sense of purpose in their lives.

The wizened orangutan at the beginning of the film (the Great Lawgiver, played
by John Huston), finishes the narration begun in the prologue (which takes place
over 600 years later) to a group of young humans and apes. Instead of humanity
falling and apes rising to take their place, the two species have continued to
coexist. However, Screenwiter Paul Dehn stated that the last shot of the film
showing a tear on the statue of Caesar was to let the audience know that
Caesar's plans may have ultimately failed. It could also be a clue to mankind's
eventual fall as seen in the earlier films.

 Casting

While Roddy McDowall returns and John Huston appears as the Lawgiver, the
casting of this film otherwise showed the diminishing stature and budget of the
series. As was becoming routine in the "Apes" movies, actors who were largely
known for television appearances or supporting film work were cast in leading
roles, particularly Claude Akins and Severn Darden, and in this entry they even
received movie-star billing with their photos featured prominently on the film's
poster. This fact, as well as the stunt casting of musician Paul Williams as one
of the apes, combined with the minimalist sets to give the film a movie-of-the-
week aura. Curiously, France Nuyen, who even at that time was arguably a bigger
star than most of the top-billed actors, received poor billing in a small role,
though the extended DVD cut restored much of her screen time.

 Extended Cut

The CBS television version adds a few scenes cut from the theatrical release.
One scene takes place after Aldo chases teacher Abe, where MacDonald reminds him
why humans should not say "no" to an ape. Another scene towards the end of the
film shows the beginnings of the House of Mendez cult, as the humans in the city
are about to fire off the doomsday bomb (as seen in Beneath the Planet of the
Apes), but decide not to, as it would threaten the world. If checked carefully
in "Beneath", one can see signs of Mendez being around the Forbidden Zone, as
there is a hymnal on the pipe organ reading "Mendez II", busts of past leaders
of the mutant society (such as Mendez XIV), and the leader of the mutant society
in "Beneath" is also named Mendez (presumably a descendant of the Mendez in
"Battle"). It is clear that Governor Mendez has taken a different tack of
leadership from his predecessors, Kolp and Breck, in that he is more sympathetic
to the apes living their own lives; so long as they do not invade the mutant
territory, and starting up the religion of the bomb. It is also possible that he
has now started a theocracy with the leader being called Mendez, and coming to
power through hereditary succession.

In 2006, the Planet of the Apes movies were re-released separately and in a new
box set. When Battle for the Planet of the Apes was re-released on the box set
and separately, it was advertised as a digitally-remastered, extended version
with 10 minutes of additional footage.

This version has been released before, via bootleg, and has been widely
acknowledged by Apes fans as the definitive version. Here listed are the
additional scenes:

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Peterhead

Coordinates:

Peterhead is a town in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It is Aberdeenshire's largest
settlement, having a population of approximately 19,000. Peterhead sits at the
easternmost point in mainland Scotland. Peterhead is often referred to as 'The
Blue Toon' and people who were born there as Blue Tooners. More correctly they
are called Bloomogganners, supposedly from the blue worsted stockings that the
fishermen originally wore. In May 2007, the Peterhead Football Club adopted as
its fan song "The Blue Toon Tune".

 History

Peterhead was founded by the Keith Earls Marischal in 1587, and was developed as
a planned settlement. In 1593 the construction of Peterhead's first harbour,
Port Henry, encouraged the growth of Peterhead as a fishing port and established
a base for trade. A lifeboat station was first established in 1865. Since early
times Peterhead has received a portion of its water supply from Morris Wells. In
Peterhead prison was opened in 1888, gaining a reputation as one of Scotland's
toughest prisons. A new phase of growth was initiated in the 1970s with
Peterhead becoming a major oil industry service centre, and the completion of
the nearby St Fergus gas terminal. At this time, considerable land holdings were
allocated for industrial development.

In recent times, the town has suffered from several high profile company
closures and is facing a number of pressures, including Common Fisheries Policy
reforms. However, it retains a relatively diverse economy, including food
processing, textiles, service industries and, still importantly, fishing. (Over
90,000 tonnes of fish, with a value of around £60m are now landed at Peterhead,
which is still also base to over 550 fishermen.) Peterhead Bay Authority plan to
extend the northern breakwater as a stimulus to the town's economic development.
In addition, to assist with business diversification and town centre
environmental improvements, the 'Peterhead Project' initiative under the
Aberdeenshire Towns Partnership brings together the Council, Scottish Enterprise
Grampian, Communities Scotland, commerce and community representatives.

Until April 2005, the Royal Air Force station RAF Buchan was located near the
town.

 Education

 Peterhead Academy

Peterhead Academy houses around 1400 pupils and the school is split up into 8
houses (Arbuthnot, Buchan, Craigewan, Grange, Marschall, Ravenscraig, Slains and
Ugie), with all the names associated with areas of the town. The school has
pupils coming from surrounding villages such as Boddam, Cruden Bay, Hatton,
Inverugie, Rora and St Fergus.

 Primary schools

Peterhead has seven primary schools (Clerkhill, Buchanhaven, Meethill, Dales
Park, Central, Burnhaven, Anna Ritchie), Clerkhill being the largest.

 Transport

Peterhead has a number of in-town and out-of-town bus services.

Peterhead once had two railway stations Peterhead railway station and Peterhead
Docks railway station, but both are now closed.

 Tourism

The harbours, maritime and built heritage are the town's principal tourism
assets. Recent initiatives include investments in the Peterhead Bay area, which
have included the berthing of cruise ships in the harbour. A number of projects
are planned under the auspices of the Peterhead Project initiative, including
tourism strategy development, enhancement of existing attractions, measures to
improve the town's physical attractiveness, and improved marketing and
promotion.

 Sport

Peterhead F.C. are a Scottish Football League side who currently play in the
Second Division.

Maria Island is a mountainous island off the east coast of Tasmania. The entire
island is a National Park. Maria Island National Park has a total area of 115.50
km² which includes a marine area of 18.78 km², off the island's north-west
coast. The island is about 20 km in length from north to south and, at its
widest, is about 13 km west to east. At its closest point (Point Lesueur), the
island lies four kilometres off the east coast of Tasmania. Tasmanians pronounce
the name "MA-RYE-UH" (məˈraɪə), as did the early British settlers, but the
original pronunciation was "MA-REE-UH" (məˌriːə). The island was named in 1642
by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman after Maria van Diemen (nee van Aelst), wife of
Anthony van Diemen, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies in Batavia.
The original, Aboriginal name for the island was Toarra-Marra-Monah.

 Local community and economy

The strait between Maria Island and the east coast of mainland Tasmania is
called Mercury Passage.(named after John Henry Cox's ship "Mercury" who charted
the area in 1789). There are two towns of size in this part of the East Coast:
Orford at the mouth of the Prosser River and Triabunna, some eight kilometres
further north at the head of Spring Bay.

There is but one "town" on Maria Island and a peculiar one it is by any
standards. It is called Darlington and it lies near the northern tip of the
island. Darlington is beautiful and historic and has many wonderful old
buildings, but it has no permanent inhabitants other than a few park rangers.
All the rest - up to several hundred during the summer holidays - are tourists
who come and go.

Tourism is important to the local economy. In nearby Triabunna other major
industries are fishing, forestry and farming. An export woodchip mill is located
at Freestone Point 5 km south of the town. Rock lobster (known locally as
crayfish), scalefish, scallops and abalone are taken near the island by both
commercial and recreational fishermen, and mussels are farmed in Mercury
Passage.

 History

Maria Island has a rich history. Before the colonial era, Aboriginal people of
the Oyster Bay or Paredarerme tribe journeyed regularly to the island and much
evidence of their presence remains, particularly around the bays on either side
of the island's isthmus. In 1802 the French expedition led by Nicolas Baudin
encountered the Aboriginal people of Maria Island, as did the whalers of the
early 1800s. René Maugé, the zoologist on Baudin's expedition, was buried on
Point Maugé on south Maria Island.

For two periods during the first half of the 1800s, Maria Island hosted convict
settlements. The island's first convict era was between 1825 and 1832 and its
second - the probation station era - between 1842 and 1851. Among those held
during the second era was the Irish nationalist leader William Smith O'Brien,
exiled for his part in the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848. His cottage still
exists in the former penal colony. He was later transferred to New Norfolk on
the Derwent River upstream of Hobart.

Three structures from the first convict era remain in the Darlington area: the
Commissariat Store built in 1825 and presently used as the park's reception and
visitor centre; the convict penitentiary, completed in 1828 and now used to
accommodate visitors rather than detain them; and the convict-built dam on
Bernacchis Creek, which still provides Darlington's water today.

From the 1880s, the Italian entrepreneur Diego Bernacchi set up island
enterprises including silk and wine production and a cement factory, quarrying
limestone deposits at the Fossil Cliffs for the raw material. At the height of
its fortunes in the early 20th century, Darlington had hundreds of residents and
several hotels. By 1929 all of these ventures had failed for a number of reasons
including the Great Depression, poor quality limestone and competition from
mainland producers, who were not burdened with high costs of transportation. For
a period of 40 years until the late 1960s the island was dominated by farming.
Eventually the State resumed all of the island's freehold land and established
Maria Island National Park, which was proclaimed in 1972 and extended in 1991 to
include a portion of the surrounding sea.

 Geography and natural history

Maria Island takes the form of a figure-eight, with the northern section of the
island significantly larger than the southern. Both parts of the island have
quite rugged relief and they are joined by a tombolo about 3 km long known as
McRaes Isthmus. The highest point, Mt Maria, is in the northern part of the
island and stands 711 m above sea level.

Fourteen distinct terrestrial plant communities occur on the island, which is
mostly clothed in various forms of eucalyptus forest. Natural and historical
clearings provide grazing for many animal species, such as Common Wombats and
Tasmanian Pademelons. Nearly all of the island's animals are native to Tasmania
but some of these, such as Eastern Grey Kangaroos, Red-necked Wallabys and Cape
Barren Geese, were introduced to this island refuge from the Tasmanian mainland
during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Feral cats on the island are descendants
of cats brought to the island by Europeans since the 1800s. Other species
include Common Brushtail and Common Ringtail Possums, Short-beaked Echidnas,
three species of snake and many birds, both terrestrial and marine.

Maria Island is perhaps the best place in Tasmania for observing forest birds,
and is home to 11 of the 12 bird species that are endemic to Tasmania. It is the
stronghold for the endangered Forty-spotted Pardalote, one of Tasmania's twelve
endemic bird species.

In early 2005, captive Tasmanian Devils were introduced to the island and are
cared for by the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service staff who live on the
island. These devils form part of the "insurance population" of devils
unaffected by the devil facial tumour disease that is sweeping through mainland
Tasmania's devil population. Because Maria Island's devils are subject to strict
quarantine, visitors to the island are not able to see or interact with them.

The marine section of the national park protects a representative area of
Tasmanian East Coast marine habitat, and has significantly larger individuals
and populations of key marine species than surrounding waters. This area is one
of the most intensively studied marine protected areas in Australia and is
popular with divers. The marine section of the park extends from an unnamed
point north-east of Bishop and Clerk, westwards to Cape Boullanger and then
southwards as far as Return Point. The marine boundary’s definition varies, but
it is never more than 1 kilometre from Maria Island's low water mark.

 Transportation and accommodation

A ferry provides a daily service from the town of Triabunna to the jetty in
Darlington Bay at the northern end of Maria Island, a distance by sea of 16 km
or nearly nine nautical miles. In summer the service is twice daily. A previous
ferry operation out of Louisville (near Orford) is now defunct. Common Dolphins,
Australian Fur Seals and seabirds such as Australasian Gannets and Shy
Albatrosses are often seen on the voyage.

Very basic accommodation is available in Darlington in "the Penitentiary", a
former place of internment, built during the first convict era. Bookings can be
made with the Parks and Wildlife Service. There are ten rooms that have bunk
beds with vinyl mattresses, a table and chairs and a wood heater. Nine of the
rooms sleep 6 people each and the tenth sleeps 14. All cooking gear, lighting,
bedding and food must be brought to the island. There is no electricity or
running water in the rooms, but toilets, hot showers and barbecues are nearby.
Many visitors also choose to camp in the camping area in Darlington - an advance
booking is not necessary for this. The visitor will look in vain for a shop,
hotel or restaurant, and anyone who travels to the island must be self-
sufficient.

 Activities

Walking, bicycling, swimming, snorkelling, diving, bird watching, wildlife
observation and relaxation are the main activities undertaken by visitors. Many
people take interest in Maria Island's history, and most of the island's walks
include sites of historic interest. The Painted Cliffs and the Fossil Cliffs are
two popular walking destinations for day visitors, both on the island's
coastline. The Painted Cliffs are sandstone with beautiful patterns formed
through staining by iron oxide. The Fossil Cliffs are tall limestone cliffs
containing prolific ancient fossils. Longer day walks include tracks that ascend
Bishop & Clerk (620 m) and Mt Maria (711 m). Mount Maria is a six to seven hour
return walk from Darlington while Bishop and Clerk can be completed in about
four hours return.

Nearly all roads and tracks on the island are suitable for bicycling. Bicycles
and helmets can be rented in Hobart and brought over on the ferry. A bicycle is
a must for those who want to see as much of the island as possible on a day
trip. Bicycle-riding is not permitted on beaches or on the two mountain tracks.

A vehicular track extends from Darlington twenty kilometres south to Haunted Bay
on south Maria Island, with a number of side-tracks and points of interest along
the way. Haunted Bay is so named because of the constant calling in the evening
of the many fairy penguins that live there. The track south is the usual route
for people doing bike rides or multi-day walks. The major campsites outside
Darlington are at Frenchs Farm, 11 km from Darlington, and Encampment Cove, a
further 2 km away, which is also used by boating visitors. This area is referred
to by boaters as Chinamans Bay (Chinamans is the bay just north of Encampment
Cove). Both Frenchs Farm and Encampment Cove have rainwater tanks. The Frenchs
Farm tank is less likely to run out during summer. Water can be hard to find
elsewhere.

From Encampment Cove it is only a little more than a kilometre's walk to the
ruins of Maria Island's second (probation-era) convict station at Point Lesueur
on the island’s west coast (also known as Long Point). Soldiers Beach and
Bloodstone Beach on the western side of the island are also well worth the
effort that it takes to reach them, as are Shoal Bay and Riedle Bay, the beaches
either side of McRaes Isthmus.

In 2007 a disused coastal trader, the Troy D, was sunk outside the marine
section of the national park, 1.7 km west-southwest of the Painted Cliffs, with
the intention of creating a dive wreck.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Myopathy

In medicine, a myopathy is a neuromuscular disease in which the muscle fibers do
not function for any one of many reasons, resulting in muscular weakness.
"Myopathy" simply means muscle disease (myo- Greek μυσ "muscle" + -pathy Greek
"suffering"). This meaning implies that the primary defect is within the muscle,
as opposed to the nerves ("neuropathies" or "neurogenic" disorders) or elsewhere
(e.g., the brain etc.). Muscle cramps, stiffness, and spasm can also be
associated with myopathy.

 classes

Because myopathy is such a general term, there are several classes of
myopathy.... (ICD-10 codes are provided where available.)

 Treatments

Because different types of myopathies are caused by many different pathways,
there is no single treatment for myopathy. Treatments range from treatment of
the symptoms to very specific cause-targeting treatments. Drug therapy, physical
therapy, bracing for support, surgery, and even acupuncture are current
treatments for a variety of myopathies.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Strike Fleet

Strike Fleet is a 1987 computer game developed by LucasArts and published by
Electronic Arts. It was released for the Amiga, Apple II, Atari ST, Commodore
64, and DOS. Strike Fleet is the unofficial sequel to the war game PHM Pegasus.

The player controls either the American or British Fleets over the course of ten
scenarios, of which the last four can be played as a single campaign. The player
must fight against the navy and air force of various other nations including
Argentina, the Soviet Union, and Iran.

A review in Computer Gaming World described the game as a marked improvement
over PHM Pegasus due to the added excitement and variety, while still
maintaining the graphics and historical accuracy of that game. Minor complaints
were directed at some UI decisions regarding the bridge interface and weapons
systems.

 Scenarios

 1. Stark Realities

As the Captain of a U.S. frigate, your ship is stationed in the Persian Gulf as
part of a routine patrol. Defend yourself and all neutral shipping in the Gulf,
but do not fire unless attacked first. You may encounter friendly and enemy
ships as well as aircraft. You must tread the thin line between provocation and
overcaution, and decide what actions to take, if any.

 2. The Enemy Below

On May 1, 1982, two British frigates were providing ASW coverage for their
forces near Port Stanley on the Falkland Islands, when they detected, and were
fired upon, by the Argentine sub San Luis. Neither side acknowledged a hit that
day. Now it’s your turn to relive the situation. Your mission is to search for,
and destroy, Argentine submarines that may be in the area.

 3. The Road to Kuwait

Now, with a larger, more powerful task force, you must escort three reflagged
Kuwaiti tankers through the dangerous Persian Gulf, and out to the Arabian Sea
while watching for possible air and sea attacks. Do not fire unless fired upon.
Be certain your targets are truly foes, and be particularly alert in the Strait
of Hormuz. Make full speed to remove the oil tankers from danger as soon as
possible.

 4. Falklands Defense

Britain is battling it out with Argentina for control of the Falklands.
Argentina has an attack squadron fueled and ready for launch from their carrier
- weather conditions are the only thing that hampers their progress. Your
mission is to engage and take out Argentine task group 79.4 - composed of three
frigates - which is supporting the main attack force.

 5. Dire Straits

You are escorting a small convoy of empty oil tankers into the Persian Gulf,
when you find your task force confronted by speedboats armed with guns and
grenades. Repeated warnings go unheeded, and if you don’t take action, your task
force will be surrounded. Get those tankers safely through the Strait of Hormuz
and into the Persian Gulf. You have weapons-free clearance - neutralize any and
all opposition. Good luck, Commander.

 6. Atlantic Cork

Welcome to World War III. Bottle up the Soviet fleet in the Norwegian Sea before
they escape through the Greenland-Iceland-U.K. gap. You’ll meet your objective
if you sink enough of their ships and subs to seriously cripple their forces.
Two Orion search planes, operating out of Iceland, will provide sub hunting
support to your fleet.

Our satellites have spotted a large surface fleet just northeast of your
position, and the SOSUS line hears approximately a dozen various Soviet nuclear
attack subs racing at high speed for the gap between Greenland and Iceland.
Split your forces as you see fit, but stop those ships and subs! Our satellites
also show pictures of Backfire bombers loading up at their home bases -watch-out
for those long-range Kingfish missiles.

Scenarios 7 - 10 may be played individually or as part of a four scenario
campaign

 7. Surprise Invasion

A Soviet invasion fleet is heading for Trondheim, Norway and your small task
force is all that stands between them and it. With some sharp strategy, quick
reactions, and some luck, you’ll complete your objective by sinking their
Polnochny supply ships and Ropucha troop carriers.

 8. Escape to New York

You command a small task force whose objective is to make a fast transit to the
U.S. east coast. Soviet subs, cruisers, and bombers stand in your way. The
submarine threat is particularly strong in this scenario.

 9. Wolfpack

Your objective is to escort a convoy of reinforcements to a U.S. base in
Iceland. Get your task force to within a few dozen miles of the Iceland coast to
complete your objective. You can probably expect fierce attacks from a large
Soviet surface fleet that our satellites have spotted just west of your position
at the start of the scenario.

 10. Mopping Up

The end of the war is in sight, and we have done well for ourselves. But the
Soviets may yet win if we allow them to get their ships and subs back to their
northern bases for more fuel and supplies. Search out all Soviet submarines and
ships that will be heading north or northeast. Your objective is to prevent the
enemy from reaching home - use extreme prejudice.

Scenarios 11 and 12 are bonus missions included in the PC version of the game

 11. Bunker Hill Blues

Mission: Defender your ship. Destroy all hostile forces Enemy: Soviet surface
air and submarine forces. Comments: Keep a cool head and move quickly. Use AA
missiles wisely.

 12. One for the Gipper

Mission: Destroy at least two enemy oil platforms and one frigate then survive
undammaged until end of day. Enemy: Iranian surface and air forces Comments: The
enemy forces are small but can hit hard. You have weapons free. Fire when ready.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Garden of Kama

The Garden of Kama is a book published in 1901 and written by Adela Florence
Nicolson under the pseudonym Laurence Hope, and illustrated by Byam Shaw. The
poems in the book were passed off as translations of Indian poets by a man, and
thus the book received much more attention that they would likely have done if
she had published them under her own name. All of the poems in the book were
original works, none were actually translations.

The poetry in this volume was characteristic of all of Nicolson's poems, making
liberal use of the imagery and symbols from the poets of the North-West Frontier
of India and the Sufi poets of Persia. The poems are typically about unrequited
love and loss.

The book was initially praised upon its released by many prominent poets, Thomas
Hardy among them, although some reviewers were uncertain about the authenticity
of the translations. James Darmesteter, Professor of Persian at the prestigious
College de France, Paris documented the images used by the frontier "bards" as
being symbols of the latent Sufi nature of their songs and they were "exposed"
as being original works.

The book was published in America in 1942 as India's Love Lyrics.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Collett Leventhorpe

Collett Leventhorpe (May 15, 1815 – December 1, 1889) was a brigadier general in
the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.

 Early life

Collett Leventhorpe was born May 15, 1815 to Thomas Leventhorpe and Mary Collett
in Exmouth, Devonshire, England. Thomas died, probably of tuberculosis, about
nine weeks after Collett's birth. Leventhorpe's ancestry could be traced back to
the 14th century and was connected to royalty through marriage and service.

Leventhorpe studied at Winchester College until the age of fourteen. For the
next three years he was educated by a private tutor.

In 1832 Leventhorpe purchased the rank of ensign in the 14th Regiment of Foot
(the Buckinghamshire's), in the army of King William IV. Leventhorpe was
stationed in Ireland for the next three years. He purchased a lieutenancy on
November 2, 1835, and was stationed in the British West Indies. After several
years of duty there he spent a year in Canada. Leventhorpe reached the level of
Captain of Grenadiers, on November 16, 1842. He then transferred to the 18th
Regiment of Foot and on October 24, 1842 he sold his Captaincy in order to
travel to South Carolina on business for an English company.

 Antebellum life

In 1843, while on an extended holiday in the United States, Leventhorpe traveled
to Asheville, North Carolina, where he met his future wife, Louisa Bryan,
daughter of General Edmund Bryan, of Rutherfordton, NC.

Leventhorpe entered the Medical College of Charleston in Charleston, South
Carolina. He graduated at the top of his class then married Louisa on April 1,
1849 and the couple made their home in Rutherfordton. Interestingly, Leventhorpe
never practiced medicine. In 1849, Leventhorpe applied for and was granted
United States citizenship.

 Civil War

When North Carolina seceded Leventhorpe offered his military services to his
adopted state. His community standing and military background won him the rank
of colonel in the 34th North Carolina Infantry. He spent the early months of the
War drilling and disciplining the regiment and by December he was given
temporary command of a brigade. During the winter of 1861-62 he was at Fort
Branch near Hamilton, North Carolina guarding the Roanoke River and the Weldon
Railroad Bridge. In April 1862 he was transferred to the 11th North Carolina,
elected its colonel and was sent to the Atlantic coast to head the District of
Wilmington. Later that year he manned the defenses along Virginia's Blackwater
River. Returning to North Carolina in December, he led his troops impressively
at the Battle of White Hall, which slowed Federals under Brigadier General John
G. Foster in their advance toward Goldsboro, North Carolina. In mid-December,
Leventhorpe's 11th North Carolina was attached to the brigade of Brig. Gen. J.
Johnston Pettigrew. During this period, Leventhorpe complained that he was being
held back from higher command because of his foreign birth and lack of political
connections, though he was offered a command in the cavalry but declined it due
to his lack of experience in that branch. After helping repulse an attack during
the Siege of Washington, in April 1863, Pettigrew's Brigade joined General
Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia for the Gettysburg Campaign as part of
Major General Henry Heth's division in Lieutenant General A. P. Hill's Corps.
With the rest of Heth's command, the 11th North Carolina participated in the
July 1 fighting at the Battle of Gettysburg. Leventhorpe was seriously wounded
in fighting against the Iron Brigade after flanking the 19th Indiana south of
Herbst's Woods. He was wounded in the left arm, shattering the bone, and hip and
was removed from the field. Leventhorpe was captured by Union cavalry during the
retreat to Virginia. The Union surgeon tending to him detected that gangrene had
set in his wound and suggested amputation but Leventhorpe refused, so submitted
to allowing the surgeon to cauterize the wound with nitric acid and Leventhorpe
refused anesthesia, saying he "would have died, rather than let an enemy see
that a Confederate Officer could not endure anything without a complaint." His
arm discharged bone fragments for three months. He survived the operation, but
was held at Fort McHenry and Point Lookout for eight months before he was
exchanged, with friends in England sending him money to purchase necessities
while held in prison. After he was released, he resigned his commission with the
11th North Carolina and took command of one of the North Carolina Home Guard
brigades tracking down deserters. He was later commissioned brigadier general of
state troops and he defended the Roanoke River, Fort Branch, and the Petersburg
& Weldon Railroad. His state generalship made him the Confederacy's only English
born soldier to hold that rank. On February 18, 1865, he also became a Brigadier
General in the Confederate ranks, but 3 weeks later he refused the appointment,
choosing instead to remain in state service. His troops defended Raleigh when
Major General William T. Sherman marched through North Carolina. He and his men
retreated to Greensboro, where they surrendered on April 26, 1865.

 Post-War career

After the war, Leventhorpe was involved in several business enterprises and
politics following the War. He and his wife moved to New York City and also
traveled frequently to England. Leventhorpe was sympathetic to the Ku Klux Klan
during Radical Reconstruction, though no record exists of his joining the Klan.
He eventually settled in Wilkes County, North Carolina, where he died on
December 1, 1889.

kisaeng Hwang Jin-i, starring Song Hye-kyo in the title role.

 Plot summary

The story follows Hwang Jin Yi, a kisaeng who lived in 16th century Korea. Hwang
Jin-Yi was a beautiful, talented and intelligent young woman who was able to
read and write well, but because she was an illegitimate child, she had no other
recourse but to become a kisaeng where she used her position to gain favor with
the noble classes.

 Cast

 Box office performance

"Hwang Jin-yi" did poorly at the box office, barely grossing $2.5 M. However, it
was awaited by many before its release due to the star power of Song Hye-kyo,
and many expected the film to be a great success.

Allen Manvel (September 26 1837 – 1893) was the eleventh president of the

Manvel was born in Alexander, New York. In 1859 he began employment with the
Rock Island Railroad as a clerk in the purchasing agent's office. He worked his
way up through the ranks to become the general superintendent. His employment
shifted to the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway (SPM&M) in 1881, where
he started as assistant general manager. He was promoted through a series of
management positions there to become the general manager himself.

In 1889 he left the SPM&M to succeed William Barstow Strong as president of the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, a position he held until 1893. Manvel was
succeeded by Joseph Reinhart.

 Legacy

Like other Santa Fe presidents, Manvel's name was adopted as the name for a town
in the American West. The town of Manvel, Texas, was named in his honor.

Men's 50 metre rifle three positions (then known as small-bore free rifle) was
one of the thirteen shooting events at the 1992 Summer Olympics. It was the
first Olympic competition after the introduction of the new target in 1989, and
thus two Olympic records were set, by Juha Hirvi (qualification round) and
Gratchia Petikian (final). Petikian won ahead of Robert Foth and Ryohei Koba,
after a poor final demoted Hirvi to fourth place.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Damn the Torpedoes (album)

Damn the Torpedoes is an album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers released in
1979 (see 1979 in music). The title is a reference to a famous quote by Admiral
David Farragut. The album was recorded at Sound City in Van Nuys and Cherokee
Studios in Hollywood.

This album, the band's third, was their first for MCA Records. Their old label,
ABC Records, had been sold to MCA; Petty struggled to legally detach himself
from MCA, but in the end was forced to settle. He negotiated a deal that allowed
him to release his recordings on the new Backstreet Records label, manufactured
and distributed by MCA. Damn the Torpedoes ended up being the band's
breakthrough hit, and includes many of their best reviewed songs and favorite
concert standards today, including "Here Comes My Girl" (the third single
release, charting at #59), "Even the Losers" and "Shadow of a Doubt (A Complex
Kid)".

Damn the Torpedoes was a #2 hit (for seven weeks and kept from #1 by Pink
Floyd's The Wall) on the Billboard's Pop Albums chart, and yielded two songs
that made the top-fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, "Don't Do Me
Like That" (#10) and "Refugee" (#15), both in early 1980.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 313 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the
500 greatest albums of all time.

 College career

Andre Durie played CIS football for York University in Toronto. He started
playing for the York Lions in 2003 after he set a junior Ontario Varsity
Football League record with 22 touchdowns in a season. In 2004, Durie had a
record-breaking season starting eight games at running back and set an Ontario
University Athletics record for single game rushing yards with 349 and single-

 Canadian Football League career

After overcoming injuries that hurt his CIS career, Durie impressed the
Argonauts management at the league evaluation camp and he appeared in 5 games
for the Argos in 2007. After suffering another injury setback which has cost

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Distraction (game show)

Distraction is a British game show shown in Canada on the Comedy Network, US on
Comedy Central, New Zealand on UKTV & TV2, and other countries through various
networks. Presented by comedian Jimmy Carr, the show involves contestants
answering questions, while being distracted in various bizarre, painful and
humiliating ways.

The format was devised by Fremantle television and was sold to the U.S. network
Comedy Central in 2004, where it lasted two seasons. The first season of the US
version was shown starting on January 18, 2005, and the second season began
airing on January 10, 2006. Jimmy Carr has hosted all episodes of both English-
speaking versions. Digital channel Challenge started broadcasting repeats of the
show on February 5, 2007, although these repeats are slightly edited due to
longer advert breaks on the channel compared to Channel 4's.

 Gameplay

At the start of the show there are four contestants, usually two women and two
men. Before the first round, they "get to know each other", finding out about
each other's embarrassing moments, unique hobbies, strange talents, or previous
unflattering occupations.

The first three rounds are usually quizzes involving rather easy questions.
However, these rounds feature various distractions (hence the name) to cause
pain and/or discomfort while contestants try to answer them. The distractions
may be endured throughout the round, activated in order to answer questions, as
punishment for incorrect answers, or as a result of getting a question right. At
the end of each round, the player who has performed worst is eliminated and
receives nothing.

Distractions have included being shocked with electricity such as with electric
dog collars, pushing buzzers surrounded by cacti (while blindfolded), sticking
one's hand in live mousetraps to answer a question, being shot with paintballs,
urinating in a specially designed toilet to activate one's buzzer, contestants
drinking shots of hot sauce or their own urine, and being hung upside down and
tickled on the soles of the feet.

In the fourth and final round, instead of answering questions to win prizes, the
prizes are given to the winner upfront; however, the contestant must then answer
several further questions to prevent these prizes from being damaged and/or
destroyed. For example, if the prize is a car, getting a particular question
wrong could result in the losing contestants getting to spray paint graffiti on
the side of it, smash the windscreen, or key-scratch the door(s) of the car. If
a set of smaller prizes is at stake, each incorrectly answered question will
result in the destruction of one of them, (say, by being blown up or hit with a
wrecking ball).

 UK and US Versions

Round 1 is always an on-the buzzers quiz (the "buzzers" being some of the items
described above.) Round 2 may be another on-the-buzzers quiz, or an individual
time trial in which each player is given 45 seconds (or so Carr claims) to
answer questions while continually being distracted by someone or something
else. Round 3 is a head-to-head round similar to round one, and is usually a
race to 4 or 5 points.

Sometimes in round 1 or 2 (of both the US and UK versions), players must attach
clothespins or rubber bands to their faces while answering questions; the player
with the most clothespins/rubber bands on their face at the end of the round
gets five extra points, and usually moves on because of this bonus.

After three rounds (and thus three eliminations), the final winner faces the
prize round as explained above.

 Italian version

In 2006, a version of Distraction began airing in Italy, with Teo Mammucari
hosting the first season and Enrico Papi set for hosting the second season in
2007. Six contestants play in this version, with the same rules applying as the
original two versions. Famous comedians and celebrities act as "judges"
throughout the game, and instead of the contestants being interviewed at the
beginning of the show, their casting tapes are shown instead.

Additionally, This is the only version of "Distraction" still on-air with new
episodes.

Also, they play a game called "Hole in the Wall", similar to the Japanese Game
Show of the same name.

 Dutch version

In 2006, a Dutch version (called "Rat van Fortuin") began airing, with Ruben
Nicolai as the host. The gameplay is the same as in the US/UK version.

 Israeli version

Also in 2007, an Israeli version (called "Behafraa [בהפרעה]") began airing,
hosted by Ido Rozenbloom, So far 21 episodes have been taped, the gameplay is
the same as in the US/UK version.

 Uruguaian version

In 2006, an Uruguaian version (called "Distracción") began airing with Orlando
Petinatti as host. The gameplay is the same as in the US/UK version. This
version was airing by Saeta TV Channel 10 from Uruguay, and produced by ZUR
Infotaiment from Uruguay too.

 Paraguaian version

In 2008, an Paraguaian version (called "Distracción") began airing with Álvaro
Mora as host. The gameplay is the same as in the US/UK version. This version was
airing by , Channel 4 from Asunción, Paraguay, and produced by TV Acción S.A.
from Paraguay too.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[John Roberts (television reporter)

John D. Roberts (born November 15, 1956 in Toronto, Ontario) is a television
journalist for CNN, where he is a co-anchor of CNN's morning program American
Morning. He anchors from Washington D.C. and New York. Roberts became a United
States citizen after the 9-11 terrorist attacks; under the law of both
countries, he was able to do so without renouncing Canadian citizenship.

He also served as the first anchor of This Week at War and served as the Senior
National Correspondent based in Washington. He has also substituted for Anderson
Cooper on Anderson Cooper 360.

Prior to CNN, Roberts served as Chief White House Correspondent at CBS from 1999
to 2006, and regularly anchored a Sunday-afternoon 3 p.m. ET newscast for the
CBS Radio Network. He had been widely considered a potential replacement for CBS
Evening News anchor Dan Rather after Rather stepped down from the anchor desk in
March 2005, but Bob Schieffer was chosen on an interim basis to be the next CBS
Evening News anchor, and in subsequent months, it became clear that Roberts was
not under consideration for the job. In February 2006, Roberts left for CNN.

Roberts grew up in Mississauga, Ontario. He attended Lorne Park High School and
later the University of Toronto at Mississauga, and worked for many years in
Canadian media before joining CBS News in 1992.

Roberts first started working in radio at the local college station CFRE-FM, in
Mississauga, Ontario. He briefly worked on-air on radio station CJBK in London,
Ontario in 1977, moving back to Toronto to top-40 powerhouse CHUM that year,
where he was heard as weekday evening host. In 1979, he branched out from his
music personality work to function as an entertainment reporter and co-host with
Jeanne Beker of the music newsmagazine The NewMusic until 1985. Roberts also
worked briefly with CIXK in Owen Sound, Ontario in the 1980s. He was a video
jockey with CITY-TV owned MuchMusic, a music video channel on which he and
Christopher Ward appeared as the first on-air personalities when the network
launched in 1984. At MuchMusic he also hosted a one hour Heavy Metal video show
called "The Power Hour." He also served as an entertainment reporter and anchor
on CITY-TV's CityPulse, and became anchor of CityPulse Tonight in 1987 when Anne
Mroczkowski moved from anchoring that newscast to join Gord Martineau on the 6
pm edition.

Starting in 1989, Roberts began his 17-year association with CBS television and
radio. Between 1989 and 1990 Roberts was an anchor/reporter for WCIX-TV (now
WFOR-TV), the CBS-owned and operated television station in Miami, Florida.
Roberts returned to Canada in September 1990 to co-host the national CTV morning
show Canada AM, initially with Deborah McGregor, and later with Pamela Wallin.
He also anchored the 5 and 11pm newscasts at CBS's flagship station in New York,
WCBS-TV.

In March 2003, Roberts was embedded with the 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance
Battalion of the U.S. Marines during the initial invasion of Iraq. In October
2006, he returned to Iraq to anchor several editions of This Week At War and
report for the Special Investigations Unit documentary "Death Squads".

On July 19, 2005 he introduced CBS's coverage on the announcement of the
nomination of John G. Roberts, Jr. for the Supreme Court of the United States.
He once joked in a newspaper column that he asked to be referred to as "Your
Honor" because he and Justice Roberts bear the same name.

Soon after, Roberts left CBS and joined CNN. Together with CNN colleague
Anderson Cooper, he won critical praise for his work covering the Hurricane
Katrina disaster which devastated New Orleans and the American Gulf Coast.

In July and August 2006, Roberts reported from the front lines in the
Israel/Hezbollah war and at one point, embedded with an Israeli infantry unit,
marching 10 miles into Lebanon. CNN's coverage of the war was recognized with an
Edward R. Murrow Award.

In September 2008, Roberts was criticized for not being a journalist after an
interview concerning Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, he ignored a
proven lie Alex Castellanos restated and suggested the discussion could go on 56
more days.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Angels of Mission

Angels of Mission is a TVB series consisting of 20 episodes. It stars Charmaine
Sheh, Sonija Kwok and Shirley Yeung as Police.

 Plot

In the beginning, Yiu Lai Fa (Charmaine Sheh) and Tong Bo Yee ,Bowie (Shirley
Yeung) are Police in Central Intelligence Division (C.I.D.). Fa is a sergeant.
Then, with the Counter-Terrorist Unit (CTU) requiring more members, Fa and Bowie
are transferred to the CTU, for the time being. Song Lok Kei, Sam(Sonija Kwok)
is the leader of the CTU. After their first case is complete Bowie and Fa are
transferred back to the CID. Sam thinks Fa and Bowie are great cops. With Fa's
amazing fighting skills and Bowie's great aim/hand eye coordination, Sam thinks
they should be part of CTU. So she tells them to go through the training and try
to apply for a position.

In this series, there are Four Major cases which the CTU will work on.

The first case is about a a guy named Lin Hok Man who is a business man but
spends money in buying illegal fire arms. Sam sends a Undercover cop, Bill,
which later requests to be relieved of duty because he knows Lin Hok Man knows
about his identity. Bill is later killed by Lin Hok Man's henchmen. After Bill
dies Sam is very upset and regrets not taking Bill's advise when he asked to
stop. Her Boss tells Sam to find another cop to go undercover but she advises
they shouldn't. Her boss sticks to what he decided and Sam has to chose someone
to go undercover. While this is going on Fa and Bowie are in CTU training and
having completed it they are now accepted into the team with two other men. When
they arrive to CTU Sam decides to send Fa to be her undercover cop. With CTU
backing her up she accepts the challenge and takes the identity of Flora. Fa
slowly blends in and becomes Lin Hok Man's girlfriend. However, being the
careful man he was, Lin Hok Man soon suspects her identity. Sure enough, when he
tests his theory, cops arrived at his designated location. He sends his
bodyguard Herman to kill Fa. With CTU losing connection with Fa, She gets into a
big fight with Herman. After a thrilling showdown, Bowie and Sam arrive on the
scene and aid Fa in fighting Herman. They soon killed Herman but Lin Hok Man
told his men to blow up all the weapons and most of the evidence is destroyed.
Lin Hok Man was trialed for breaking maritime and business law. He decided to
plead guilty because he knows he will get a lighter sentence.

The second case is about an anthrax threat. The person responsible demands HK$ 1
billion to stop the threat. After a while, the CTU manages to capture him in an
alley. They found no evidence on him. Before he got arrested, he placed the tube
of anthrax in a bag of a little boy who was studying at the alley. The boy is
the son of a coffee shop worker, Lee Chin Jun(Ram Tseung), who leaves the boy in
the alley behind the shop when he is working. The boy's mother is in China but
will be coming to Hong Kong soon. When she arrives, the coffee shop owner offers
her a job to work in the store room. Later, she gets raped by the coffee shop
owner while she was working. When her husband was confronting the shop owner,
she gets hit by a car of a gangster. After his wife's death, he falls into the
state of depression. He finds the tube of anthrax in his son's bag and decides
to take revenge for his wife. He kills the gangster and the coffee shop owner
with the tube of anthrax. Later, social services takes his son into foster care
because the father has been abusing him. During the court trial for his child,
he kidnaps his child with a gun and threatens to use the anthrax if the police
come near. When he is near a cinema he spotted the CTU personnel, and held the
tube out. Bowie is the only person who has a clear shot of him and is ordered to
neutralise him. She shot him in the chest ending the case.

The third case is about a political assassination. Lee Tin Wah (Stephen Au) is a
body guard for a politician visiting Hong Kong, and sees the police as
incompetent. CTU is sent in to aid with the protection of the Politician. Sam
puts Fa in charge of the case. Lee Tin Wah and Fa don't get along very well in
the beginning. Lee Tin Wah doesn't cooperate well with Fa and the rest of CTU.
Fa is very careful and Lee Tin Wah believes in his ability to protect his
client. In a situation with a undercover bellboy Fa Kills the assassin bellboy
and Lee Tin Wah seems to loosen up a bit with Fa. Fa doesn't give up and in the
act to get the Run Down for the next few days from Lee Tin Wah, Fa fallows him
the rest of the day. Fa then finds out its not Lee Tin Wah's fault but its the
politician who is uncooperative. In a event in which the politician has to
attend assassins started firing and Lee Tin Wah and Fa end up running into a
building by themselves to capture the assassin Lee Tin Wah fires the assassins
gun into Fa's chest, having known she was wear a bullet proof vest, and knocks
the assassin unconscious and the case ends. Lee Tin Wah and Fa then become
friends and Fa is happy that Lee Tin Wah saved her life. Lee Tin Wah then flies
back with the politician and leaves.

The final case Lin Hok Man is released since he had a light sentence and wants
revenge on Sam and Fa for what they did earlier. Lee Tin Wah comes back to Hong
Kong and tells Fa he loves her and that he has a new job as Lin Hok Man's
bodyguard. Fa finds out that Lee Tin Wah and Lee Gin Keurng(Patrick Tam), her
next door neighbor who she likes, are actually brothers. Lin Hok Man had
implanted, Felix, a computer genius, inside the CTU itself, later on Lin Hok Man
kills Felix's Wife and Daughter and Felix is very man and tries to take revenge.
Felix goes to kill Lin Hok Man but is killed instead by his bodyguards. Fa goes
after Felix but is captured by Lin Hok Man. Lin Hok Man tests Lee Tin Wah's
faithfulness orders him to kill her. Lee Tin Wah couldn't bring himself to kill
Fa so he shots her in the leg and in the chest knowing she would be wearing a
bullet proof vest. Fa is injured and sees Lee Gin Keurng's feelings for her but
she knows hes with Sam now. Sam is told to rest from her job due to an incident
earlier with a witness. The witness was supposed to prove Lin Hok Man was evil
but Lin Hok Man went and bribed the witness and told him to say that the CTU
members were bribing him and not listening to his needs and taking his freedom
away. He then was sent to the hospital because he tried to commit suicide. He
later dies because Lin Hok Man sends men in to pretend to be doctors and gives
the witness a shot which kills him. Sam is blamed for this and is told to take a
rest from work. Sam is getting strange emails in giving her tips about Lin Hok
Man. Sam doesn't know who it is but has a hint after Fa was shot. Sam finds out
that it was Lee Tin Wah and finds out that hes undercover CIA. The CIA told Lee
Tin Wah to stop the mission and Lee Tin Wah goes to CTU for help and asks them
to back him up. Later Lin Hok Man finds out about Lee Tin Wah and captures him.
Lin Hok Man is anger that his plans were all spoiled and tells Lee Tin Wah that
he will kill him and the girl her loves and his only brother. Fa being at the
hospital just woke up from a coma of a few days. Lee Gin Keurng is at the
hospital with her and Fa notices an assassin sent to kill them she and Lee Gin
Keurng try to escape but Lee Gin Keurng is captured and Fa escapes. Sam finds
out about Lin Hok Man's plan to leave Hong Kong. Sam is also now told to come
back from her break and re-lead the team. Sam and the rest of CTU go to the
location in which Lin Hok Man will leave from they set up their positions but
just before they leave they see Fa and she wants to join the mission Sam lets
her and they take off. They see Lin Hok Man but he has Lee Tin Wah and Lee Gin
Keurng with him. A random shooter comes from a boat and shots Lin Hok Man to
death. Lee Tin Wah then escapes and they kill Lin Hok Man's Bodyguards. The
Problem now is that Lee Tin Wah and Lee Gin Keurng has bombs attached to them
with only a few seconds left Lin Tin Wah removes the bomb from Lee Gin Keurng
and he jumps into the ocean. With everyone believing he was death he suddenly
floats back up and is alive. The Case is then ended.

After this the story goes on about how Sam and Fa force Lee Gin Keurng to chose
one of them but he runs away from his problems in the end Bowie comes up with a
plan in which was to at 12 o'clock depending on which color the building turned
would decide which girl he chose. After this Sam and Fa go to the spot to see
but at the last few seconds they decide it didn't matter to them and they both
leave. Sam and Fa then both ignored Lee Gin Keurng's phone calls and they don't
ever see him again. The series then ends with them showing how Lee Gin Keurng is
now married and has a child and Sam, Fa, and Bowie are still friends and are
loving the single life.

 Conclusion

The whole series portrays Romance, Action etc. In the end Charmaine Sheh and
Sonija Kwok waits for Patrick Tam to make a decision, they believe that the
building will determine who he will choose, when the building turns blue at 12,
then he would choose charmaine, and if turns red, then he would choose sonija,
the three of them awaiting for the answer, but at the end, the two girls decided
to walk away and not care what patrick will choose, and while Shirley Yeung gets

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Monroe Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey

Monroe Township is a Township in Middlesex County, New Jersey, United States. As
of the United States 2000 Census, the township population was 27,999. Monroe was
incorporated as a township by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 9,
1838, from portions of South Amboy Township, based on the results of a
referendum held that same day. Portions of the township were taken to form East
Brunswick Township (February 28, 1860), Cranbury Township (March 7, 1872) and
Jamesburg (March 19, 1887).

Clearbrook Park, Concordia, Rossmoor and Whittingham are census-designated
places and unincorporated areas located within Monroe Township.

 History

Monroe Township was founded in 1838 and named in honor of the President of the
United States James Monroe. For many decades, it was largely a farming
community; when parts of the township blossomed into the more densely-packed
neighborhoods of Helmetta, Jamesburg, and Spotswood in the late 19th century,
they seceded. Railroads came into Monroe from just about the very beginning,
starting with the Camden and Amboy Rail Road in the 1830s and 1840s.

In 1905, Bernarr Macfadden, the then-famous proponent of physical culture, came
to the part of Monroe near Helmetta and Spotswood, and attempted to set up a
camp called "Physical Culture City", where he could teach his beliefs in
relative peace. However, in 1907, Macfadden was arrested for distribution of
pornography and the camp dissolved. The area of this camp became the Outcalt
neighborhood.

The New Jersey State Home for Boys, later the Training School for Boys, and now
the  was established near Jamesburg. It was opened in 1867 as a home for
troubled youth; however, by the mid-20th century, its purpose was to incarcerate
juvenile delinquents. One of the more famous residents of The State Home was
Rubin "Hurricane" Carter. Clarence Clemons of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street
Band was a social worker there for many years during the 60's before he found
fame as a sax player with Springsteen.

The township's largely agrarian landscape began to turn more suburban between
1960 and 1968, when the New Jersey Turnpike opened up Exit 8A in the western
part of Monroe, in conjunction with the effort to develop the Leisure World age-
restricted community of Rossmoor. Since then, at least five more communities for
senior citizens have joined Rossmoor: Concordia, Clearbrook, Greenbriar at
Whittingham, The Ponds, and Encore, and the prestigious Regency at Monroe. More
are under development.

At the same time, and over the next few decades, suburbs for people of all ages
spread into the northern parts of Monroe Township, prompting the expansion of
several schools and the construction of new ones. Since 1980, in addition to the
age restricted communities, Monroe has added shopping centers, a synagogue, a
recreation center, and a new library

On Wednesday March 22, 2006, ten residents of Monroe Township, from The Ponds
retirement community, were killed in a tour bus accident in the Andes mountains
in northern Chile. The tour had been arranged by the Jewish organization, B'nai
B'rith. As Governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine put it, "Today, all of New Jersey
is stunned and saddened by the tragic accident in Chile that took the lives of
lifelong friends — vibrant and beloved residents of a community in Monroe
Township who chose to share the adventure of their twilight years together" (NY
Times). Of the 12 people killed, one couple was from Stamford, Connecticut. The
bodies that were recovered were flown back to Monroe Township for funerals on
Sunday March 26, 2006.

Over the past years, Monroe has had a surge in residential development. New
communities are being erected usually around the Turnpike. Portions of Monroe's
farmland are beial zoning, and commercial zoning. Roads have been widened to
allow for the extra vehicular volume. Warehouses are being/have been constructed
in the last few years along CR 535, located near the 8A toll gate. The northern
section of the township is already developed, with developers heading further
south in Monroe to start new communities. New adult communities have set ground
in central Monroe, along Route 33, and on CR 615. While these new senior citizen
housing units are being built, luxury homes are also being constructed. However,
many senior citizens are opposed to these new construction plans since new homes
would bring in more children, and therefore raise their school taxes.

There has also been a proposal to expand the Monroe Township High School by
relocating it onto portions of Thompson Park (which is slowly receiving approval
after an archaeological study concluded that the land was not historically
significant, except about 3 or 4 acres (16,000 m) of land). The controversy that
led to the study involved a Lenape settlement, Bethel Indian Town, which
protesters contended existed on the site, whereas supporters of the move of the
high school claimed that Bethel Indian Town was a half-mile away. In late April
2008, construction started of the new high school. The new high school is
scheduled to open in September of 2011.

Monroe is planning on developing the area of land along Route 33 (Route 33 Land
Development Task Force) all the way from the town line in East Windsor Township
to Millstone Township. This proposal would include the construction of new
luxury houses, a new grocery store, a baseball park, a performing arts center, a
bus stop, new restaurants, and new businesses.

Along County Route 619, new developments are beginning to surge forward. This
surge has led 619 to be widened as an avenue in anticipation for the future
traffic. A proposed grocery store is planned to be built at the corner of
Applegarth Road, and Halsey Reed Road/Federal Road (Extension). Along Federal
Road, new luxury houses are being built and will extend south towards the
village of Applegarth. Along the Millstone River will be a new high class
development, called the Millstone Preserve. These new developments are under
construction.

 Geography

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of
42.0 square miles (108.9 km²), of which, 41.9 square miles (108.6 km²) of it is
land and 0.1 square miles (0.3 km²) of it (0.24%) is water. It is the largest
municipality in Middlesex County in terms of total land area.

Helmetta, Spotswood, East Brunswick Township, the Township of Old Bridge, and
completely surrounds Jamesburg in Middlesex County, Manalapan Township and
Millstone Township in Monmouth County, and East Windsor Township in Mercer
County.

 Demographics

As of the census of 2000, there were 27,999 people, 12,536 households, and 8,236
families residing in the township. The population density was 667.6 people per
square mile (257.8/km²). There were 13,259 housing units at an average density
of 316.1/sq mi (122.1/km²). The racial makeup of the township was 93.31% White,

1.3% of families and 3.3% of the population were below the poverty line,
including 2.9% of those under age 18 and 3.0% of those age 65 or over.

 Neighborhoods

Though Monroe is not officially broken down into neighborhoods (the Census-
designated places oriented around active adult communities notwithstanding),
over the years residents have given names to various parts of the township.
Three common names heard in the township are Mill Lake Manor (an area centered
around Monmouth Road and 10th Avenue) and Outcalt (in the northern part of the
township, near Spotswood and Helmetta).

For those who have lived in Mill Lake Manor, the area is broken down further
into the "Old" and "New" Manor (split by Monmouth Road on the east and west
sides, the Old being east and the New being the west side). The Manor also
encompasses the developments of Inwood.

The neighborhood east of Spotswood-Englishtown Road, centered around Monmouth
Road, extending down to 1st Avenue, is called the North Manor, or Manor Heights.

 Education

The Monroe Township School District serves students in kindergarten through
twelfth grade. Schools in the district (with 2005-06 enrollment data from the
National Center for Education Statistics) are  (K-2; 664 students),  (K-3; 642),
(3-6; 805),  (4-6; 483),  (K-6),  (7&8; 664) and Monroe Township High School for
grades 9-12 (1,395)

During the 1991-1992 academic school year, Mill Lake Elementary School received
the Blue Ribbon Award from the United States Department of Education, the
highest honor that an American school can achieve. This honor was followed
during the 1998-99 academic school year, to Barclay Brook Elementary School
across town. Both of Monroe Township's pre-K through third grade schools
received such an esteemed honor.

Students from Jamesburg attend Monroe Township High School as part of a
sending/receiving relationship with the Jamesburg Public Schools.

 Transportation

Some of the age-restricted communities, such as Rossmoor and Concordia, have
their own transportation services within the communities. In addition, Middlesex
County runs  to Jamesburg from East and New Brunswick (the New Brunswick shuttle
schedule is at ). Since Monroe entirely surrounds Jamesburg, Monroe Township
also benefits from the shuttles.

Route 33 runs through the southern part of Monroe, which then travels through
Millstone Township and East Windsor Township. Monroe has various bus stops that
allow passengers to take a bus to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, adjacent to
the Lincoln Tunnel. Monroe's most busiest roads during the peak hours are
Applegarth Road, Forsgate Drive and Route 32, which connects to the New Jersey
Turnpike (Interstate 95). Exit 8A is located on the western edge of Monroe
Township, with a 9-lane toll gate, featuring a "modified" double trumpet
interchange (with a few ramps continuing into South Brunswick Twp).

Monroe Township is known for the Turnpike's division (where it divides into
Inner Car Lanes & Outer Truck Lanes) and its dangerous (and often-congested)
merge, where the dual-dual configuration ends (5 lanes each direction; 2-3-3-2)
and becomes a single roadway, consisting of three lanes in each direction (3-3);
the merge is particularly difficult to travel through on Friday afternoons,
summertime and on holidays. When the turnpike is congested (in the 8A vicinity),
many motorists exit in Monroe Township at 8A and use 32 West to U.S. Route 130
south. Since 8A has become so busy, the turnpike interchange has been upgraded.
The ramp (from the Turnpike) that merges onto 32 west, has been destroyed; a new
two-lane ramp is now open that connects to County Route 535 (with a traffic
signal) in South Brunswick Twp. Motorists must then take 535 south to gain
access to 32 westbound.

The New Jersey Turnpike Authority had proposed to construct a west-east spur of
the Turnpike, NJ 92. It would begin at US 1 just north of the intersection with
Ridge Road in the Twp of South Brunswick and would terminate at Exit 8A in the
area of the 8A toll gate in Monroe Township.

On December 1, 2006, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority terminated its plans to
build the spur from Ridge & 1 in South Brunswick to 8A in Monroe. The
Authority's main focus will now be on widening the Turnpike between Exit 6 (in
Mansfield Township) and Exit 8A (in Monroe Township).

At the present time, there are plans to widen I-95/New Jersey Turnpike between
Exit 9 in East Brunswick Township to Exit 8A in Monroe Township. This would
change the dual-dual configuration (from 2-3-3-2) to "3-3-3-3."

Monroe houses a few county routes: CR 535, CR 522, and CR 527. While CR 520
doesn't pass through Monroe, it turns into CR 612. This makes CR 520/612 a
connector between Shore Points/Garden State Parkway (Exit 109 in Middletown
Township) and the New Jersey Turnpike at Exit 8A in Monroe Township. (However,
some maps (such as Tele Atlas) indicate that 520 traverses through Monroe
Township, and ends at CR 613.)

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Drake Circus Shopping Centre

Drake Circus Shopping Centre is in the centre of Plymouth, England. It is a
60,800 m² (654,000 ft²) covered shopping mall which opened in October 2006.

The new building, designed by London-based architects Chapman Taylor and built
by Bovis Lend Lease and situated behind the ruined Charles Church, preserved as
the city's civilian war memorial, has provoked a mixed reception. Just after it
opened, the shopping centre won the 'Carbuncle Cup for crimes against
architecture' for being the worst new building in the UK. However in 2007 it won
two retail industry national awards, one of which was the Retail Week magazine's
"Shopping Location of the Year". Also in 2007, the centre's management
introduced a code of conduct which, like one the Bluewater centre
controversially introduced in 2005, banned hooded tops and baseball caps.

 History

The term circus as used here refers to an open space, usually circular, where a
number of roads meet (see, for example The Circus (Bath)). Drake Circus was
originally a large oval roundabout built in the early years of the 20th century
at the junction of four roads. The roundabout consisted of Edwardian buildings
that housed shops, one of which carried the "Guinness Clock", which was visible
to people travelling up Charles Street and was a landmark in the city of the
time.

All of these buildings were demolished in 1966-7 as part of the Plan for
Plymouth, leaving an open roundabout. At this time the lower section of
Tavistock Road to the north was renamed Drake Circus, and in the early 1970s,
just to the south of the roundabout, a new two-level shopping centre with open
malls was built around a large C&A store. This was also named Drake Circus.

Initial proposals to redevelop this mall in the early 1990s failed, but the
developers, P&O Estates, tried again in the early 2000s. Plans were drawn up for
a much larger centre, and after Allders signed up as the first "anchor" tenant
in 2001, work started in February 2004 on demolishing the old centre and the
adjoining Charles Street multi-storey car park.

The scheme suffered a setback in January 2005 when Allders went into
administration. New tenants Next and Primark committed in 2005 and the building
opened in October 2006.

On 3 February 2005 it was announced that the shopping centre had been sold by
P&O Estates to Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund for the sum of £55m. On 20
November 2006 it was announced that Kandahar Real Estate had taken a 50 per cent
stake in the centre.

The unusually configured new traffic junction on the northern side of the centre
has resulted in prolonged traffic gridlock for many hours every weekday since
opening.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Earthworm Jim 2

Earthworm Jim 2 is a platform video game released in 1995. It is a sequel to the
original Earthworm Jim. The music was composed by game music veteran Tommy
Tallarico. Earthworm Jim 2 follows the exploits of annelid superhero Jim and his
new sidekick Snott as they try to rescue Jim's beloved Princess What's-Her-Name
from a forced marriage to the nefarious Psy-Crow. While chasing them across the
universe, Jim comes across the summer homes of a number of villains from the
first game, including Evil the Cat and Bob the Killer Goldfish.

The game originally appeared on the Mega Drive/Genesis, Super NES and MS-DOS,
with enhanced versions later released on the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. It was
also ported to the Game Boy Advance. Like the original game, Earthworm Jim 2
contains a lot of irreverent, random humor. It also features more diverse
gameplay than the original, with each stage having a different style and
mission, as well as various new weapons.

 Gameplay

Jim must travel to many levels in order to stop Psy-Crow and his evil plans.

 Development

 Reception

 It was voted the 12th Best Genesis Game by Screwattack.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Barbara Lea

Barbara Lea (born Barbara LeCoq on April 10 1929 in Detroit, Michigan) is an
American actress and singer.

 Background

Lea was born into a musical family; her musical heritage is traceable to a great
uncle, Alexandre Charles LeCoq — an important nineteenth-century composer of
French light opera.

Boston was a hotbed of jazz in the late 40s and early 50s, allowing Barbara to
sing with major instrumentalists such as Marian McPartland, Bobby Hackett, Vic
Dickenson, Frankie Newton, Johnny Windhurst, and George Wein. Lea also worked
with small dance bands there before attending Wellesley College on scholarship
and majoring in music theory. She also sang in the college choir, worked on the
campus radio station and newspaper, and arranged for and conducted the Madrigal
Group and brass choir concerts.

Her professional career started upon graduation. Her early recordings for
Riverside and Prestige met with immediate critical acclaim and led to her
winning the DownBeat International Critics' Poll as the Best New Singer of 1956.
She appeared in small clubs in New York, including the renowned Village
Vanguard, and throughout the eastern U.S. and Canada, as well as on radio and
TV.

She studied acting to improve her stage presence and, with the near-demise of
classic pop in the early 60s, turned to the legitimate theatre, performing an
impressive list of leading and feature roles in everything from Shakespeare to
Sondheim. She moved to the West Coast and received her M.A. in drama at Cal.
State-Northridge, then returned to New York and taught speech at the American
Academy of Dramatic Art and acting at Hofstra University.

In the 1970s, with the resurgence of interest in show tunes and popular
standards, Barbara Lea was literally sought out to appear in the Peabody Award-
winning National Public Radio series "American Popular Song with Alec Wilder and
Friends". This led to two lengthy feature articles in The New Yorker (where
Whitney Balliett declared "Barbara Lea has no superior among popular singers")
and a renewed singing career.

Barbara has starred in the JVC, Kool, and Newport Jazz Festivals several times,
but her increasing devotion to the songs as written has led to concerts of the
works of Rodgers and Hart, Arthur Schwartz, Cy Coleman, Cole Porter, Hoagy
Carmichael, and the Gershwins, as well as cabaret appearances devoted to Kurt
Weill, Jerome Kern, Johnny Mercer, and Yip Harburg.

She has over a dozen CDs currently available on the Audiophile label, which has
a reputation for featuring the best in singers of classic pop, plus reissues of
two early LPs on Fantasy/Original Jazz Classics, three recent releases on the
European-based label, Challenge, as well as three new releases on her private
label.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Viva la Vida (song)

"Viva la Vida" is a song written and recorded by English alternative rock band
Coldplay. It was produced for their fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death
and All His Friends. The single was first released on 7 May 2008. It is
Coldplay's biggest hit to date, reaching number one in the United Kingdom and
the United States.

 Background

Vocalist Chris Martin has explained the song lyric "I know Saint Peter won't
call my name" in an interview with Q magazine: "It's about ... You're not on the
list. I was a naughty boy. It's always fascinated me that idea of finishing your
life and then being analyzed on it. And this idea runs throughout most
religions. That's why people blow up buildings. Because they think they're going
to get lots of virgins. I always feel like saying, just join a band (laughs).
That is the most frightening thing you could possibly say to somebody. Eternal
damnation. I know about this stuff because I studied it. I was into it all. I
know it. It's still mildly terrifying to me. And this is serious." When asked
about the song, bass guitarist Guy Berryman said, "It’s a story about a king
who’s lost his kingdom, and all the album’s artwork is based on the idea of
revolutionaries and guerrillas."

Unlike the typical arrangement of Coldplay songs, in which either the piano or
guitar dominates, "Viva la Vida" mostly consists of a string section playing the
song's upbeat riff, along with a steady bass drum beat, percussion (including a
timpani and a church bell), bass guitar, and Chris Martin's vocals; there is
limited use of electric guitar in the song.

The song's Spanish title, "Viva la Vida" is taken from a painting by 20th
century Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. It directly translates into English as "Live
Life," meaning "long live life".

 Release and promotion

"Viva la Vida" was initially released only with iTunes Store pre-orders of Viva
la Vida or Death and All His Friends on 7 May 2008 as the "New Edit" of the
song, which led to the song's temporary exclusion from the UK Singles Chart. It
was released as a download-only single on 25 May 2008, and a physical CD single
in Europe on 29 July 2008, to coincide with the release of the single's music
videos.

The song was used as part of Apple Inc.'s iPod + iTunes advertisement campaign,
while Coldplay performed the song live for the first time at the 2008 MTV Movie
Awards. It has since gone on to make many media appearances, featuring in the
episode "We're Not in Kansas Anymore" of the new teen drama 90210 as a song
played on the radio, and also appearing on the international soundtrack to the
Brazilian soap opera A Favorita, as well as being played during the final week
of games at Yankee Stadium.

 Chart performance

"Viva la Vida" has become the band's most successful song, becoming their first
number one in both the U.S. and the UK. Fuelled by high digital sales, the song
debuted at #15 on the Billboard Hot 100, and later became the band's first #1
single and their second top ten on the Hot 100. It is the first song by a
British group to reach #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 since "Wannabe" by the Spice
Girls in 1997, and it is the first song by a British rock band to top the chart
since UB40's 1993 song "Can't Help Falling in Love". Although at first the song
was primarily successful in digital sales in the U.S., after being released it
went on to become the band's biggest radio hit in the U.S., becoming their first
top ten hit on the Hot 100 Airplay, where it peaked at #8. It was also
successful on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart reaching number one, their
first number one on the chart, beating out previous songs "Talk" and "Speed of
Sound" which peaked at #5 on the same chart. On the Adult Top 40, the song has
become the band's first number one, as well as the first single on the Capitol
Records label to ever top the chart.

Although the song had been disqualified from the UK charts due to initially
being available only by pre-ordering the album on iTunes, it became eligible to
chart after the album was released and hit #1, becoming Coldplay's first chart-
topping single in the UK. After descending to number 2 just a week and number 7
the following week, the single dropped out of the top 10, but over a month later
on 17 August 2008, it re-entered the top 10 at number 10, probably due to the
release of the Viva La Vida music video on UK music channels.

The song reached the top ten in Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, The
Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Ireland and Australia, becoming Coldplay's highest
charting single in most of those countries.

 Plagiarism allegation

Coldplay were briefly accused of copying portions of "The Songs I Didn't Write"
by American alternative band Creaky Boards, for the melody of "Viva la Vida".
Creaky Boards' band member Andrew Hoepfner claimed that Chris Martin had heard
the track at one of their shows. Coldplay denied the claims; band spokesman
Murray Chambers said "Chris was working in AIR Studios in London" at that time.
Creaky Boards later retracted the accusations and now speculate that both songs
may have been inspired by the video game The Legend of Zelda.

 Music videos

The official music video for "Viva la Vida" was directed by Hype Williams and
premiered at Coldplay's official website on 1 August. The video features the
band performing in multi-colour backgrounds, including the album's artwork (used
for the majority of the video) and speeding clouds (used in between verses and
in parts of the final chorus). The video ends with every band member crumbling
to rose petals that fly into the air.

A second, alternate video was shot in the Hague, the Netherlands, directed by
Anton Corbijn and released alongside the first. This second version is a tribute
to Corbijn's video for Depeche Mode's "Enjoy the Silence" and portrays Chris
Martin as the king from whose perspective the song is sung. During the video, he
carries a larger framed version of the cover art for the album. At the end, we
see him hang the picture up in a white stall on top of a hill. As he sings the
last chorus, his band mates surface heading his way, tying in loose ends from
the Violet Hill video.

A parody of this music video (Viva la Cheata) was done on the FOX sketch show
MADtv. It starred Jerry O'Connell as John Edwards who sings about how his affair
and possible love child has ruined his political career, but is confident that
he'll rebound since political sex scandals have been around for a long time.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Zeil am Main

Zeil am Main is a town in the Haßberge district in Lower Franconia, an area in
the federal state of Bavaria, Germany. It is situated on the right bank of the
Main, 7 km east of Haßfurt, 24 km northwest of Bamberg, and 25 km east of
Schweinfurt. Zeil is a historic Franconian town known for its old churches,
romantic houses, medieval walls and towers, the hill church of "Zeiler Käpelle",
and the castle ruins of the Schmachtenburg.

 History

Zeil am Main is located in an area of the River Main valley where, since the
11th century, the dioceses of Würzburg and Bamberg overlapped and vied for
domain of the region. Zeil's strategic location between the dioceses, situated
on the River Main trade route and military road between Nuremberg and
Schweinfurt, ensured that Zeil was worthy of possession by regional powers.

The earliest evidence of Zeil am Main as a city is in a 1018 AD deed of donation
signed by Henry II, King of the Romans. Bishop Lamprecht of Prun granted
municipal law to the city in 1379 and allowed citizens of Zeil to build
protective fortifications. As a result, the city wall was constructed with
numerous towers, and Schmachtenberg castle was built. King Wenzel of Bohemia
entitled the community with special laws to use the river Main commercially in
1397. The prince bishops of Bamberg used Zeil's strategic location as a northern
enclave to provide a buffer against their Würzburg rivals, and 1695 saw the
construction of a hunting lodge for the prince bishop. In the early 1800s,
church lands were securalized, and Zeil am Main became a municipality within
Bavaria by edict in 1818.

 Culture

Viticulture is still practised in Zeil. Vines are grown on mountain slopes
around the city. The summer wine celebration in the old part of town is the high
point of the year. In addition, the Göller brewery's Zeiler beer bears the name
of the city.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Daikatana

Daikatana is a first-person shooter computer game developed by Ion Storm and
published by Eidos Interactive. Released on April 14, 2000 for Windows, it was
led by John Romero. The game is known as one of the major commercial failures of
the computer game industry. Daikatana was later ported to the Nintendo 64. A
different version of the game was developed for the Game Boy Color, with a
version for the PlayStation canceled during development.

The game takes place during the year 2455 AD, in a world suffering from a major
pandemic caused by a man named Kage Mishima. Through use of a magical sword
called the daikatana, Mishima traveled back in time and prevented the disease
from being cured, allowing him to take control of the world. The protagonist
takes the form of a martial arts instructor named Hiro Miyamoto. Hiro, along
with minor characters "Superfly Johnson" and Mikiko Ebihara, attempts to recover
the daikatana, traveling to a number of different times and places in the
process.

Daikatana's title is written in Japanese kanji which mean "large sword", but
their correct reading is actually "daitō" in Japanese (see Daikatana (sword)).
The name comes from an item in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign played by the
original members of id Software, which Romero cofounded.

 Gameplay

Daikatana has a total of twenty-four levels, divided into four episodes. The
number of maps per level varies, but is generally about three. The episodes
represent different locations and time periods: futuristic Japan, ancient
Greece, the Dark Ages in Norway and near-future San Francisco. Gameplay tends
towards fast-paced combat, although an attempt was made to include problem-
solving elements as well.

One element that Daikatana stressed was the important role of the protagonist's
two "sidekicks". The death of these sidekicks resulted in the failure of the
mission, and their assistance was sometimes required for the completion of
puzzles. Due to poor AI implementation, the sidekicks, who were one of the
game's selling points, became a focus of criticism.

 Development

Romero's initial game design, completed in March 1997, called for a huge amount
of content -- 24 levels split into 4 distinct time periods, 25 weapons, and 64
monsters. Despite this, Romero believed that development of the game could be
completed in seven months, just in time for Christmas 1997. The game was to
license the existing Quake game engine. At id Software, the content portion of
Quake had taken a nine-person team only six months. Romero had 8 artists, and
calculated that he could finish in seven. This schedule was called "patently
ludicrous" by John Carmack. Put simply, Romero did not have an established,
experienced team to rely on (see The Mythical Man Month), as Ion Storm was still
forming as a company, constantly adding new employees. Many were talented
amateurs, hired on the basis of level designs they had created.

Ion Storm showed Daikatana at E3 in June 1997. The engine was still running in a
software mode, and looked outdated and unimpressive. At the same time, id
Software was debuting their Quake II game engine, featuring hardware
acceleration and innovative visuals. Romero realized that they were falling
behind technologically. The Christmas 1997 deadline was quietly dropped, and the
new plan was to keep creating the content for the game, and switch to the Quake
II engine as soon as it was ready. The game was rescheduled for a March 1998
release.

The Daikatana team received the source to the Quake II engine in November 1997,
and immediately realized that the switch would not be simple. The code was
completely different from the original Quake engine, and would require throwing
away eleven months of work for a complete rewrite.

Even this would not have prevented the release of Daikatana in 1998, but
internal company politics began to erode morale. Ion Storm had grown extremely
quickly, and was spending money freely. The Dominion project, put on a fast path
by Ion Storm in a desperate attempt to generate some revenue, was resented by
the Daikatana team for stealing resources from their project. In November 1998,
morale got so bad that twelve members of the Daikatana team quit, leaving Romero
with no team, and no way to make the Christmas 1998 deadline.

In January 1999, the switch to the Quake II engine was complete. What had been
scheduled for a few weeks had taken an entire year to complete. Ion Storm
proudly announced that "Come hell or high water, the game will be done on
February 15, 1999." This deadline was missed, but a demo was released in March
1999. However, this demo failed to impress players as it featured no monsters
and no single player game, only multiplayer deathmatch.

The Daikatana team was then frantically trying to create a new, far more
impressive demo for E3 that year. Last minute changes to the level design led to
a demo that could only run at about 12 frames per second, far less than the 30
frames per second that was considered a minimum for first person shooters. The
E3 disaster led to a crisis for Ion Storm. Eidos, the parent company who had
financed Ion Storm to the tune of $25 million so far, had had enough. In June
1999, Eidos and Ion Storm reached an agreement. Eidos got majority ownership of
Ion Storm, and founders Todd Porter and Jerry O'Flaherty left the company.

Despite this turmoil, and the departure of the fourth lead programmer on the
project since its inception, Daikatana was nearing release. Ion Storm was
confident enough in its progress to schedule a huge release party for December
17, 1999. This date came and went like all the previous ones, as the bug
testing, ambitiously scheduled for a few weeks, dragged out into several months.

On April 21, 2000, Daikatana finally reached gold status. It sold 200,000
copies, which Romero claimed made up its production costs.

 Nintendo 64 version

The Nintendo 64 version of Daikatana has received particularly harsh criticism.
Since it was rushed through development (it was released about 3 months after
the PC version), significant concessions were made, and many of the flaws of the
PC version were retained.

For one, the quality of the graphics was significantly lowered. In order to keep
the framerate up, large amounts of fog were added to certain levels,
particularly in Greece. The graphics were also blurred tremendously, possibly to
hide low resolution textures. The level of blurriness increases yet further in
the multiplayer mode as well, making it nearly unplayable.

The characters Superfly Johnson and Mikiko Ebihara were completely removed from
gameplay, yet they were retained in all of the cut scenes.

Also the Daikatana sword of the title cannot actually be used.

 Controversy

From very early on in the game's development, Daikatana was aggressively
advertised as the brainchild of John Romero, a man famous for his work at id
Software in the development of Doom and Quake. Time magazine gave Romero and
Daikatana glowing coverage, saying "Everything that game designer John Romero
touches turns to gore and gold." An early advertisement for Daikatana, created
by marketer Mike Wilson and approved by Romero, was a red poster with large
black lettering proclaiming "John Romero's about to make you his bitch", a
reference to Romero's infamous trash talk during gaming. Nothing else was
featured on this poster but a small tag-line reading "Suck It Down," an Ion
Storm logo and an Eidos logo.

Following the ad's appearance in several gaming magazines, more negative news
came out of Ion Storm, fueling distaste for the game whose release was pushed
back. The lavish rock star-like treatment given to Romero in his attempt to
build a designer-centered game studio (including a multimillion-dollar office on
the top floor of a Dallas skyscraper), Romero's well-publicized expensive tastes
and hobbies (such as racing Ferraris), the dubious saga of Romero's girlfriend,
professional gamer (and later, Playboy model) Stevie "Killcreek" Case, being
hired on as a level designer, and the game's development (which included most of
the original development team quitting en masse to form a competing company),
incited fierce disdain and criticism among certain elements of the then-emergent
online gaming fan community. The press regularly published leaked gossip from
disgruntled former and current employees, providing ample and regular doses of
new drama to keep interest in the story high. Several online industry gossip
websites came into existence primarily to track the unfolding debacle, some of
which are still publishing today.

Due to these and other problems, Daikatana was delayed multiple times from its
conception in early 1997 to its eventual release in 2000. By this time, numerous
games based on more advanced graphical technology (such as Id Software's Quake
III and Epic MegaGames' Unreal Tournament) had already been released, causing
Daikatana to lag technologically in the market with its dated Quake II game
engine. Additionally, its gameplay had many aspects that were widely disliked by
players, such as an artificially limited number of saves per level and the
presence of computer-controlled "sidekicks" who were an active impediment to the
player. As a result, Daikatana garnered a mediocre-at-best reception from
reviewers and users alike. Many believe the fallout from Daikatana sidelined
Romero's career in the high-end PC gaming industry for a number of years, though
Romero himself has stated that he chose to make his next company, Monkeystone,
drastically smaller for his own reasons. The game was a major contributing
factor in the closure of Ion Storm's Dallas office.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[HOe scale

HOe or HOn30 is a popular rail transport modelling scale/gauge combination
widely used by modellers of European, American, and Japanese narrow gauge
railways.

The term HOn30 (and sometimes HOn2½) is generally used when modelling American
prototypes whilst H0e is used for European prototypes. In the Britain the term
HO9 is sometimes used. All these terms refer to models of narrow gauge railways
built to the world's most popular model railway scale of HO (1:87) but using a
track gauge of 9 mm—the gauge used for N scale models of standard gauge
railways.

The scale was invented by Egger-bahn in 1963.

HOe is one of the gauge/scale combinations defined by NEM . According to that
standard, HOe represents narrow gauges between 650-850 mm though it's often used
to represent 60cm gauge railways as well. In strict scale HOe represents a true
gauge of 783 mm so is very close to the gauge of the 750 mm (2 ft 5½ in) and
760 mm (2 ft 5⅞ in) gauge railways most widely used in Germany and the former
Austro-Hungarian empire as well as to the 2 ft 6 in (762 mm) gauge used in parts
of the British Empire.

HOn30 is often used to model the 2 ft (610 mm) gauge railroads in the US state
of Maine.

 Related Scales

The other NEM defined narrow gauges for HO scale are HOm (using 12 mm gauge
originally TT scale track) for models of metre gauge and similar prototypes and
HOi (using Z scale 6.5 mm track - also known as HOf) for prototypes around 60cm-
the most popular gauge for industrial (or Feldbahn) railways.

In the United Kingdom where the most popular railway modelling scale is 4 mm/ft
or 1:76 scale, the narrow gauge equivalents to HOe and HOm are 009 and 00n3 for
modelling 3 foot gauge railways—widely used in Ireland and the Isle of Man—on 12
mm gauge track.

The following table lists other combinations that are close to HOe/HOn3 in
either scale or gauge;

<wiki_text><![CDATA[National Youth Science Forum

The National Youth Science Forum (NYSF) is a prestigious Australian programme
dedicated to exposing year eleven students who are heading into year twelve and
are thinking about a career in science, engineering and related disciplines to
major scientific institutions and researchers, so that they may make more
informed choices for their future endeavours. They are also given training in
time management, interview skills and public speaking. In previous years it has
been known as the National Science Summer School (NSSS).

The Forum is fully residential and takes place in January at The Australian
National University where all facilities are provided for 12 days. The cost
includes travel to and from Canberra. All activities are fully supervised by
student staff and resident Rotary counsellors. The programme is extremely
intensive with little time for outside activities except for meeting those
people already in the programme.

The most important aspect coming from the NYSF is a network of friends,
colleagues and support groups throughout Australia which will be of value to
participants for the whole of their lives.

The NYSF continues after January, first in the form of university seminars and
industry site visits in March and April and afterwards as a long term personal
network of people with common aims. You can tell if someone has been to the NYSF
or NSSS by one subtle aspect of their formal wear. All will possess what is
known as a “plum pudding” badge. The badge consists of the NYSF logo and is
either red, green or blue, depending on the year attended.

 History

The NSSS was set up in 1983 by the Canberra Development Board with assistance
from many Canberra and outside organisations including Rotary, The Australian
National University (ANU), the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organisation (CSIRO) and the Canberra College of Advanced Education (CCAE) (now
the University of Canberra). The concept was developed through Mr Neville
Whiffen, then Chairman of the Canberra Development Board, with the support of
members of Rotary in District 968, Sydney, and was organised by the staff of the
CCAE.

The first NSSS was held in January 1984 with 198 students selected from across
Australia. Mainstays of the programme were Mr Bob Mitchell (subsequently
Assistant Vice Chancellor of the University of Canberra), Mr Ian Frencham
(formerly CCAE, now retired), Dr Rodney Jory (University of Canberra, the
founding Director of the NYSF), Mr and Mrs Ken Shields (Rotary Club of St. Ives,
Sydney), Mr and Mrs Ted Armstrong (Rotary, Canberra) and six Rotarian couples,
“house parents”, one couple from each State in Australia.

After this first success, the NSSS was incorporated on 5th June 1984, a Council
set up and a Director appointed.

Over the next few years, many changes were made to improve the programme. The
1985 NSSS introduced specialised activity groups and for the first time, the
Director was assisted by seven students, all of whom had attended in the
previous year, who were invited to return as staff members. For January 1987 the
NSSS was split into two sessions of two weeks, each of 138 students, 10 student
staff, two Rotarian couples, and the Director.

In 1990 CRA Limited advised that it would support the NSSS financially,
providing $120,000, and the NSSS became “The CRA National Science Summer
School”. The numbers increased to 144 per session. The scope of each of the
subject groupings was widened to provide for groups only in physics/engineering,
chemistry, biology and geology.

The 1991 NSSS saw the introduction of graduate seminars where students were able
to question former students of the NSSS, who have now graduated, on their career
choices, while the 1992 NSSS saw all student staff brought to Canberra during
the Easter break of 1991 and given additional training. Subsequently a larger
responsibility was placed on the shoulders of these people in the following
January, further emphasising the student nature of the NSSS organisation. Job
Interviews for all students were introduced in 1993, and formal University
Seminars (reunions) were held in all mainland State capitals in the following
March.

In January 1995 the NSSS changed its name to “NYSF," a name more accurately
reflecting the meaning of the programme, and in September of that same year, Mrs
Sandra Meek joined the staff of the NSSS Inc. taking over the responsibility of
maintaining the student database from Mrs Ada Meek who now was able to
concentrate more on programme matters.

January 1997 was the last CRA NYSF as CRA Limited and RTZ Plc were later in the
year merged to form Rio Tinto and this was to be the future prefix. However,
early in 1998, almost concurrently with the appointment of John Sandeman as
Chairman of Council, Rio Tinto announced that January 1999 was to be its last
year of full sponsorship (at $200,000) and that the sponsorship would be halved
for January 2000 and drop to $25,000 thereafter. Rio Tinto very generously made
$25,000 available to assist with a sponsorship search and provided two weekends
of professional seminars in which Council members and past students were given
advice into how to find sponsors. Council set an initial target of $400,000 for
January 2001 and saw this as made up of 8 University sponsors and 8 industry
sponsors each at $25,000 pa. The concept of university sponsors was only
possible after the emphasis that had been placed on universities at both
Orientation and University Seminars in the past few years.

The NYSF in January 2000 was, for the first time the “National Youth Science
Forum” with no sponsor name. Partner universities and industry groups took part
in both sessions and changed the emphasis from mining industry base of past
years to a university/industry base.

In November 2000, Mrs Ada Meek retired from the office after being with the NYSF
for 17 years. The Council expressed its gratitude to Ada for the influence she
had had on the organisation over those years. With a full time replacement for
Ada and the Director now full time, the NSSS Inc. employed, from December 2000,
4 full time staff and a part time accountant.

Applications for the January 2001 NYSF remained the same as in previous years
but surprisingly the numbers of boys and girls at session A was essentially the
same. In session B, however, there were 84 girls to 60 boys, the reason for the
big difference being a mystery. Six South Africans joined the six New Zealanders
as students included in the subject groups. Two Canadians from the Canada Wide
Science Fair were present during Session A.

In 2005, after years of dedication to the programme, the Director, Prof. Rod
Jory retired and was replaced by the current Director, Geoff Burchfield. Geoff
was previously the head of CSIRO’s Media Unit in Canberra.

 Application process

Applications are open to all Year 11 students who are permanent residents of
Australia, and are interested in proceeding to tertiary studies in Australia to
do a science, engineering or technology course. Applications close 31st May each
year for the following January forum. To become a participant of the NYSF,
Rotary International select a number of pupils in which they will sponsor to go
to the Forum, which includes an interview, impromptu speech, group and social
activities,and depending on schools and rotary clubs, examinations.

The 33rd (Lancashire and Cheshire) Signal Regiment is a British Territorial Army
regiment of the Royal Corps of Signals.

 History

The regiment was originally a TAVR II (Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve)
unit created due to defence cuts, being formed on 1 April 1967 at Huyton, near
Liverpool and consisting of four squadrons:

In 1973, 80 Squadron became 80 (Cheshire Yeomanry) Squadron, in honour of the
Cheshire Yeomanry (Earl of Chester's) from which the squadron descended. In
1969, the TAVR was re-designated as the Territorial Army.

In 1999, during the reforms implemented due to the Strategic Defence Review, the
squadron subtitles, with the exception of 80 Squadron, were changed. They
became:

 Present

The regiment's squadrons are all based in the North-West of England: 42 Signal
Squadron is based in Manchester; 55 Signal Squadron is based in Huyton; 59
Signal Squadron is based in Aintree; and 80 Signal Squadron is based in Runcorn.
The regiment provides support to the Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid
Reaction Corps, and is part of 11 Signal Brigade.

Today the regiment still provides soldiers on operations around the world
supporting the regular army.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[C. Ernst Harth

Cary Ernst Harth (born February 2, 1970) is a Canadian actor.

Harth was born in Galt, Ontario, Canada. He got his first taste of acting in
grade school when the drama club cast the school's largest child to play Santa
in their Christmas pageant. Harth was just a kindergartner at the time. Involved
in community theatre and improvisational comedy during high school, it wasn’t
until he relocated to Vancouver in 1989 that he seriously pursued acting full-
time. Prior to landing his first professional gig in a TV commercial for a food
chain, Harth toured the semi-pro wrestling circuit in Canada's small towns and
provinces as The Bible Thumper, adorned in black robes with a cross shaved on
his head.

He made his professional acting debut in Green Dolphin Beat, a Spelling telefilm

Coordinates:

Wellcome Collection is a museum at 183 Euston Road, London, England, displaying
an unusual mixture of medical artefacts and original artworks exploring 'ideas
about the connections between medicine, life and art' . The Collection comprises
three public exhibition spaces, an auditorium, events space, cafe and bookshop.
The building is also the home of the Wellcome Library and The Wellcome Trust
Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL

 History

The Wellcome Trust was founded by Sir Henry Solomon Wellcome (1853–1936). An
extensive and enthusiastic traveller, he amassed a huge collection of books,
paintings and objects, on the theme of historical development of medicine
worldwide. There was an earlier Wellcome Historical Medical Museum at 54a
Wigmore Street, housing artefacts from around the world .

The Wellcome Trust moved its administrative offices into their new Gibbs
Building (designed for the Trust by Michael Hopkins and Partners) on the
adjoining site in Euston Road, completed 2004: thereby creating an opportunity
for a new public venue in the old Wellcome Building. The Collection opened to
the public in June 2007.

 The collections

Medicine Man A permanent display of a small part of Henry Wellcome's collection.

Medicine Now A permanent exhibition using art, mixed media displays and objects
to present some aspects of modern medicine and of the work of the Wellcome
Trust. This area features a postcard wall where visitors are encouraged to
contribute drawings.

Exhibition space A changing programme of events and exhibitions.

The building foyer includes works by Pablo Picasso and Anthony Gormley. A figure
by Mark Quinn is displayed next to the entrance, originally lying unprotected on
the stone floor, but now inside a glass case.

 Wellcome Library

The Wellcome Library provides access to collections of books, manuscripts,
archives, films and pictures on the history of medicine from the earliest times
to the present day

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Aurelia Dobre

Aurelia Dobre (born November 16, 1972 in Bucharest) is a former artistic gymnast
from Romania, who was the 1987 World Champion. She is still held in high esteem
by many gymnastics fans today for her clean technique as well as balletic and
artistic flair. She was also 1st on balance beam, 3rd on vault and floor
exercise in event finals and scored a total of 5 "perfect 10's" at these
championships.

For years, she was thought to be the youngest artistic gymnastics World Champion
ever, winning her title at the age of 14 years and 352 days, until it was found
that 1981 World Champion Olga Bicherova's age had been falsified – Bicherova was
only thirteen when she won her World title.

Unfortunately, Aurelia's career was quite short because of two major injuries.
However she was a member of the silver medal winning team in the Seoul Olympic
Games and the 1989 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.

After her retirement, she caused controversy by posing nude for the September
1991 issue of Playboy Netherlands, and giving an interview to the magazine which
was highly critical of the Romanian gymnastics setup during the communist era.
She gave a similar interview to International Gymnast Magazine

Aurelia moved to America in 1991 and in 1992 she married Boz Mofid; they have 4
sons, Cyrus, Darius and twins Lucas and Marcus. Aurelia Dobre is a choreographer
and dance coach at her husbands gym in Maryland.

Most recently Aurelia was honored with an award at the Romanian Gymnastics
Federations 100 year anniversary celebrations and also recognised as one of the
Romanian gymnasts to have scored a "perfect 10"

<wiki_text><![CDATA[RWD-16

The RWD-16 was a Polish two-seat low-wing sports plane of 1936, constructed by
the RWD team, that remained a prototype.

 Development

The aircraft was designed in 1935 by Andrzej Anczutin of the RWD bureau, as a
light and economical sports plane. The plane was a wooden low-wing monoplane,
with two seats side-by-side in a closed cockpit, powered by 50 hp Walter Mikron
I straight engine.

The prototype was built and first flown in early 1936 (registration SP-AXY),
funded by the Polish division of Osram factory. The plane did not appear a
successful design, though. Test revealed lack of directional stability,
therefore its rudder was much enlarged, the wings were fitted with fixed slats
and a windshield was redesigned. It did not improve the situation much, and in
1937-1938 the prototype was rebuilt and fitted with stronger 60 hp Avia 3 engine
in a lengthened nose, while the vertical stabilizer and rudder were made
smaller. Most significant feature became a front windshield with a negative
slope.

After final changes, the prototype still was not satisfactory, but it served as
a basis for the RWD-16bis design, which was a new, redesigned aircraft, produced
as the RWD-21.

 Description

Wooden construction low-wing cantilever monoplane, conventional in layout, with
a fixed landing gear and a closed cockpit. Fuselage semi-monocoque, plywood-
covered. Single-piece trapezoid wings with rounded tips, two-spar, plywood (in
front) and canvas covered. Conventional cantilever empennage, plywood (fins) and
canvas (elevators and rudder) covered. Two seats side-by-side, with twin
controls, under a common canopy, with a fixed windshield. Conventional fixed
landing gear with a rear skid.

50 hp (37 kW) Walter Mikron I inline engine in front, with two-blade wooden
propeller Szomański, 1.8 m diameter. In later variant, 60 hp (45 kW) Avia 3
inline engine was installed.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Catherine Cornaro

Nobil Donna Catherine Cornaro (Italian: Caterina) (November 25, 1454 – July 10
1510), was Queen of Cyprus from 1474 to 1489 and declared a "Daughter of the
Venetian Republic" in order that Venice could claim control of Cyprus after the
death of her husband, James II ("James the Bastard").

 Family

She was born in Venice in 1454 and was the daughter of a well-known and powerful
family of the Republic of Venice. She was the younger sister of the Nobil Huomo
Giorgio Cornaro (Venice, 1452 – Venice, July 31, 1527), "Padre della Patria",
Knight of the Holy Roman Empire (Cavaliere del Sacro Romano Impero), Patrizio
Veneto, Podeste of Brescia in 1496 and Procurator of San Marco, who married at
Venice in 1475 the Nobil Donna Elisabetta Morosini, Patrizia Veneta, and they
had issue, called "Cornaro della Regina".

Catherine was a daughter of Nobil Huomo Marco Cornaro (Venice, December, 1406 –
Venice, August 1, 1479), Knight of the Holy Roman Empire (Cavaliere del Sacro
Romano Impero) and Patrizio Veneto (Patrician of Venice) by his wife Fiorenza
Crispo. Her father was presumably a namesake grandson of Marco Cornaro, Doge of
Venice from 1365 to 1368.  The Cornaro family had produced four Doges. Her
family had long associations with Cyprus, especially with regards to trade and
commerce. In the Episkopi area, in the Limassol District, the Cornaro family
administered various sugar-mills and exported Cypriot products to Venice.

Fiorenza Crispo was a daughter of Niccolò Crispo, Lord of Santorini. The
identity of her mother is uncertain as Crispo had two known wives. Either could
be the mother. According to his own correspondence, Niccolò was a son-in-law of
Jacopo of Lesbos.  An account by Caterino Zeno dated to 1574 names another wife,
Eudokia-Valenza of Trebizond. This Valenza was a reported daughter of John IV of
Trebizond and Bagrationi. However her alleged parents were married in 1426 and
one of Valenza's daughters was reportedly married in 1429. John IV and his wife
are unlikely to have been the grandparents of a married woman only three years
following their own marriage. Valenza is considered likely to have been a sister
of John IV, instead of a daughter. In this case her parents would be Alexios IV
of Trebizond and Theodora Kantakouzene.

Niccolò had been created lord of Syros by his father Francesco I Crispo, Duke of
the Archipelago. His mother was Florence Sanudo, a member of the previous
reigning dynasty of the Archipelago.  Florence was Lady of Milos. She was the
daughter and successor of Marco Sanudo, Lord of Milos from 1341 to 1376. Marco
wasa younger son of William I Sanudo, Duke of the Archipelago from 1303 to 1323.

She was painted by Dürer, Titian, Bellini and Giorgione.

 Marriage to James II of Cyprus

In 1468, James II of Cyprus, otherwise known as James the Bastard, became King.
In 1473 he chose Caterina for a wife and Queen of the Kingdom of Cyprus. The
King's choice was extremely pleasing to the Republic of Venice as it could
henceforth secure the commercial rights and other privileges of Venice in
Cyprus. They married in Venice, on July 30, 1468, by proxy, when she was only 14
years old. She finally travelled to Cyprus and married in person at Famagusta in
October or November, 1472.

James died soon after the wedding due to a sudden illness, and according to his
will, Caterina, who at the time was pregnant, acted as regent. She became Queen
when their infant son James died in August, 1474 before his first birthday,
under suspicious circumstances.

The kingdom had long since declined, and had been a tributary state of the
Mameluks since 1426. Under Caterina, who ruled the island from 1474 to 1489, the
island was controlled by Venetian merchants, and in 1489 she was forced to
abdicate and to cede the administration of the country to the Republic of
Venice.

According to George Boustronios, "On the 14th of February, the Queen dressed in
black and accompanied by the Barons and their ladies, set off on horseback. Six
knights held her horse's reins. From the moment she left Nicosia, her eyes kept
streaming with tears. Upon her departure, the whole population was bewailing."

Finally she was obliged to leave the island on the 14th of May, 1489 but had
been deposed since February.

 Later life at Asolo

The last Crusader state became a colony of Venice, and as compensation,
Catherine was allowed to retain the title of Queen and was made the Sovereign
Lady of Asolo, a county in the Veneto of Italy, in 1489. Asolo soon gained a
reputation as a court of literary and artistic distinction, mainly as a result
of it being the fictitious setting for Pietro Bembo's platonic dialogues on
love, Gli Asolani. Catherine died in Venice in 1510.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty

Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (メタルギア ソリッド2　サンズ・オブ・リバティ, Metaru Gia Soriddo
2 Sanzu obu Ribati) (commonly abbreviated as MGS2) is a stealth action video
game directed by Hideo Kojima, developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan
and published by Konami for the PlayStation 2 in 2001. It is the fourth Metal
Gear game produced and directed by Kojima and the direct sequel to Metal Gear
Solid.

 Overview

The story revolves around a massive offshore clean-up facility that has been
seized by terrorists calling themselves the "Sons of Liberty." They demand a
massive ransom in exchange for the life of the President of the United States,
and threaten to destroy the facility and create a cataclysmic environmental
disaster if their demands are not met. The motives and identities of many of the
antagonists and allies change rapidly, as the heroes discover a world-shaking
conspiracy constructed by a powerful organization known as the Patriots.

The game was well-received, shipping over 7 million copies worldwide and scoring
an average of 95% in Game Rankings' aggregate. The philosophical nature of its
storyline, which explores the themes of memes, social engineering, political
conspiracies, and artificial intelligence and the script in which that story is
developed divided both game reviewers and the public, though the gameplay itself
was almost universally acclaimed.

Its release was followed by an expanded edition, Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance
for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, a prequel
to the entire Metal Gear series, followed in 2004. In 2008, a direct sequel,
Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots was released.

 Gameplay

Metal Gear Solid 2 carries the title of "Tactical Espionage Action," and most of
the game involves the protagonist sneaking around avoiding being seen by the
enemies.

Most fundamental are the wider range of skills offered to the player. The new
first-person aiming mode allows players to target specific points in the game,
greatly expanding tactical options; guards can be blinded by steam, distracted
by a flying piece of fruit or hit in weak spots. Players can now walk slowly,
allowing them to sneak over noisy flooring without making a sound, or hang off
walkways to slip past below guards' feet. The corner-press move from the
original title, which allowed players a sneak peek around the next bend is
expanded to allow players to fire from cover.

In Metal Gear Solid 2, the enemy guards were given more advanced AI "to prevent
an imbalance of power", and unlike the original Metal Gear Solid, work in
squads. They call on their radios for a strike team upon seeing the player, then
attempt to flank him and cut off his escape while avoiding the player's attacks.
Often strike teams will carry body armor and riot shields, making them an even
greater threat. Even if the player escapes to a hiding place, a team will sweep
in to check the area.

Boss battles and set-pieces remain a case of finding a strategy that bypasses
the defenses of the enemy. However, in a major break from action game standards,
it is also possible to clear the entire game, including boss fights, without
causing a single deliberate death, through use of tranquilizer guns, stun
grenades, and melee attacks.

 Plot

The protagonist of MGS2 is a young rookie agent named Raiden. He is supported by
his commanding officer, the Colonel, and Rosemary, his girlfriend. Allies formed
on the mission include Lt. Junior Grade Iroquois Pliskin, a Navy SEAL of
mysterious background who provides his knowledge of the facility; Peter
Stillman, an NYPD bomb-disposal expert; Otacon, a computer security specialist;
and a "cyborg ninja" imitating Gray Fox's persona, but calling itself Mr. X.

The antagonists of the piece are the Sons of Liberty, a group of terrorists who
seize control of the Big Shell Disposal Facility, including anti-terror training
unit Dead Cell, and a Russian mercenary force. The Dead Cell team members are
Vamp, an immortal man exhibiting vampire-like attributes; Fatman, a rotund man
with an exceptional knowledge of bombs; and Fortune, a woman capable of cheating
death by apparent supernatural means. The leader of Sons of liberty claims to be
Solid Snake, previously declared dead after a terrorist attack. Assisting the
Sons of Liberty are Olga Gurlukovich, commander of a rogue Russian mercenary
army and Revolver Ocelot, a disenfranchised Russian nationalist and former
FOXHOUND agent and the henchman of Solidus Snake.

Other characters include Emma Emmerich, Otacon's stepsister and a computer wiz-
kid; Sergei Gurlukovich, Ocelot's former commanding officer and Olga's father;
President James Johnson, held hostage by the Sons of Liberty; and DIA operative
Richard Ames. Solid Snake returns, along with Liquid Snake, who communicates via
Ocelot through unknown means, and a third Snake, Solidus, is introduced.

The title features cameos by Mei Ling, the communications expert who aided Snake
in the first game, and Johnny Sasaki, the luckless soldier with chronic
digestive problems.

 Prologue - Tanker chapter

Sons of Liberty opens on the George Washington Bridge in New York City, in 2007,
two years after the Shadow Moses Island incident, the events of the original
Metal Gear Solid. Solid Snake and Otacon, now members of the non-governmental
organization Philanthropy, are investigating the development of a new Metal Gear
consistently described as being amphibious and having been designed as a
counter-Metal Gear unit which have been built since Metal Gear REX's design was
leaked. Shortly after Snake's arrival on the disguised oil tanker U.S.S.
Discovery, a group of Russian terrorists under the command of Russian
nationalist Sergei Gurlukovich attack the ship. After sneaking up to the bridge,
Snake encounters Olga, Sergei's daughter, who has refused to leave the tanker
despite being pregnant.

After he successfully tranquilizes her in combat, Snake sneaks down to the hold
in order to record pictures of the new Metal Gear, RAY. Matters rapidly escalate
as Revolver Ocelot betrays and murders Sergei Gurlukovich. It is revealed that
Ocelot has received a new arm after Metal Gear Solid, that of the late Liquid
Snake, which via unknown means causes a change in Revolver Ocelot's demeanor and
behavior, with Liquid somehow 'possessing' him. Under Liquid's control he sinks
the tanker, and escapes with RAY before regaining command of his body.

 Plant chapter

The player finds themself in control of Raiden, supposedly operating under a
reformed FOXHOUND two years after the Tanker Chapter on April 29, 2009.
Initially referred to as "Snake", his orders are to rescue hostages, including
the US president, from the terrorist group Sons of Liberty, backed up by the
rogue anti-terror training unit, Dead Cell, who are also threatening to destroy
the Big Shell clean-up facility they have seized. Raiden infiltrates the Shell
via sea while SEAL Team 10 enters by air. He joins forces with SEAL Lieutenant
Junior Grade Iroquois Pliskin and bomb specialist Peter Stillman to disable
explosives planted on the Shell by Stillman's former pupil, Fatman, now a
terrorist. While Raiden successfully eliminates Fatman, Stillman is killed as a
result of one of Fatman's traps.

With the assistance of a mysterious cyborg ninja calling itself Mr. X, Raiden
locates the president, and discovers that the Big Shell is actually a disguise
built right on top of a new Metal Gear. Known as Arsenal Gear, it houses a
powerful AI supercomputer, "GW", capable of controlling information transmitted
digitally. The president also claims the democratic process is a sham, and the
true rulers of the United States are an organization known as the Patriots.
Revolver Ocelot kills him soon after, and Raiden proceeds to his final
objective: disabling Arsenal Gear and thus halting a nuclear strike. Pliskin,
having revealed himself as Solid Snake, and Emma Emmerich, an Arsenal Gear
engineer, assist Raiden in attempting to destroy the "GW" AI by uploading a
virus. On the way to the computer room, Vamp attacks Emma. The virus is still
installed, but aborts partway through; Emma dies due to a fatal knife wound from
Vamp. Snake and Raiden are left with no choice but to disable Arsenal
physically. As Snake's partner Otacon escapes with the surviving hostages by
helicopter, Mr. X returns, revealing itself to be Olga Gurlukovich, and knocks
Raiden unconscious.

Awakening in an Arsenal torture chamber, Raiden is probed by Solidus Snake, the
true terrorist leader. Solidus reveals that he once adopted Raiden, a former
child soldier, as his son during the Liberian civil war and that Raiden is now a
Patriot agent. Olga, working as a Patriot double-agent within the Sons of
Liberty, helps Raiden escape, and he locates Snake within Arsenal Gear. As they
fight through the mammoth vessel, Raiden's commanding officer begins to act
extremely erratically, often speaking complete nonsense. It becomes apparent
that the "Colonel" that Raiden has been taking orders from is actually a
creation of the GW super-computer, pieced together from information about
Colonel Roy Campbell coupled with Raiden's own expectations in order to
manipulate him. The erratic behavior of the simulation is the result of the
virus uploaded earlier beginning to damage GW's systems.

With Snake holding off a vengeful Fortune, Raiden is forced into battle with the
25 Metal Gear RAY units guarding the Big Shell. Olga intervenes to protect him,
but is restrained by one of Solidus' robotic tentacles. Olga explains that two
years ago, right after giving birth to her child, the Patriots took her away and
have been holding her child hostage ever since. Olga continues to explain that
the Patriots blackmailed her, ordering her to become a double-agent and make the
S3 plan a success or her child would be killed. Then, Solidus shoots Olga and
throws her corpse out of the way. The RAY units begin to malfunction, attacking
each other and Solidus as the virus tears through the GW AI's program. Arsenal
begins an emergency ascent, and Snake, restrained by Fortune, Solidus, and
Raiden are carried to the roof of the fortress as it surfaces. To Solidus'
increasing rage, Ocelot reveals that he too is a Patriot agent, the entire
episode was a carefully coordinated attempt to reenact the events of the Shadow
Moses incident; what Ocelot describes as the 'S3 Plan', or Solid Snake
Simulation, designed to turn Raiden into the perfect soldier. He kills Fortune
and boards the prototype Metal Gear RAY stolen from the tanker two years
previously, and attempts to finish off the survivors of the exercise. However,
Liquid possesses him, and announces his plan to hunt down the Patriots based on
his host's knowledge. Setting Arsenal on a collision-course with New York,
Liquid-Ocelot launches RAY into the ocean, followed by Snake.

Arsenal comes to a halt in downtown New York, launching Raiden and Solidus onto
the roof of Federal Hall. Solidus reveals to Raiden his reasons for trying to
steal Arsenal: a nuclear electro-magnetic pulse would take down Manhattan's
digital infrastructure and allow Solidus to lead it as a republic against the
Patriots, a nation of "Sons of Liberty". Likewise the Patriots, via another AI,
contact Raiden to reveal the truth of their actions, the AIs being programmed to
becoming "digital censors", removing trite and needless information from the
electronic world in what they call "Selection for Societal Sanity", or "S3
Plan". The information fed to Ocelot was another part of this plan. However,
with such a control over the flow of digital information, they could as easily
be manipulating perceived history for the Patriot's needs. Believing the only
option available is to track down the Patriots using the information in Raiden's
neural implants, Solidus offers his son one final duel.

Raiden defeats Solidus, and as crowds descend upon the wreckage of Arsenal Gear,
Snake and Raiden meet one last time, where his mentor informs him that only he
can choose what to believe in, and that he must pass on what he believes to be
true. Having planted a tracking device on Liquid-Ocelot's Metal Gear, he and
Otacon plan to follow him, and to hunt down the Patriots, whose details were
hidden in the GW computer virus disc. As Snake disappears into the crowd, Raiden
is finally reunited with Rose, on April 30, 2009—the 220th anniversary of George
Washington's inauguration as President of the United States, and the anniversary
of Rose and Raiden's first meeting.

In a brief epilogue, Otacon and Snake discuss the decoding of the virus disc,
which contains the personal data on all twelve members of the Wisemen's
Committee (the Patriots' high council). It is revealed on this disc that one of
the members of the committee was a major sponsor of Philanthropy. Another
shocking revelation found on the disc indicates that not only are all twelve
members of the Wisemen's Committee dead, but have been dead for approximately
100 years.

 Cast

 Production

 Original story

According to Hideo Kojima in the documentary Metal Gear Saga Vol. 1, the
original plot of the game revolved around nuclear weapon inspections in Iraq and
Iran and had Solid Snake trying to stop the Metal Gear while it was located on
an aircraft carrier, in a certain time limit, while trying to stop Liquid Snake
and his group. However, about six months into the project the Middle East began
to heat up again and they decided that they couldn't make a game with such a
plot. The tanker in the released game is based on this original plot.

Significant changes to the game's ending were made late in development following
the September 11 attacks in New York, where the finale occurs. A sequence
depicting Arsenal Gear's displacement of the Statue of Liberty and crashing
through half of Manhattan was removed, as was a short coda to appear after the
credits, a breaking newscast showing the Statue of Liberty's new resting place,
Ellis Island. At the point where Solidus dies, Raiden was supposed to have cut
the rope on Federal Hall's flagpole, causing an American flag to fall over
Solidus' body, and American flags which were supposed to be on all the flagpoles
in New York were removed from the title.

MGS2 was also intended to reference the novel City of Glass, notably in the
naming of its characters. Raiden's support team originally featured a field
commander named Daniel Quinn (simply referred as the "Colonel" in-game); Maxine
"Max" Work, an Asian woman who saves game data and quotes Shakespeare, and
William "Doc" Wilson, the creator of GW. All take their names from key
characters in the book, and all three would have turned out to be artificial
intelligences. None of these characters survived to the final edition, their
roles being absorbed by other characters, namely the "Colonel Campbell"
simulation, Rose, and Emma Emmerich. Peter Stillman, however, takes his name
from another City of Glass character.

 Music

Hideo Kojima's choice of composer for Metal Gear Solid 2 was highly publicized
in the follow-up to the game's release. Kojima decided upon Harry Gregson-
Williams, a Hollywood film composer from Hans Zimmer's studio, after watching
The Replacement Killers with sound director Kazuki Muraoka. A mix CD containing
18 tracks of Gregson-Williams' work was sent to his office. Flattered by the
research put into creating the CD (as some of the tracks were unreleased, and
that what tracks he'd worked on for some films were undocumented), he joined the
project soon after.

In order to bypass the language barrier and allow the score to be developed
before the cut-scenes were finalized, Gregson-Williams was sent short phrases or
descriptions of the intended action. The resultant themes then shaped the action
sequences in return. Gregson-Williams also arranged and re-orchestrated the
original "Metal Gear Solid Main Theme" for use in the game's opening title
sequence.

Norihiko Hibino, who had worked on previous Konami games such as Metal Gear:
Ghost Babel, was responsible for all of the in-game music. He also worked on the
majority of the game's cut scenes, re-orchestrating Gregson-Williams' "Main
Theme" remix for use in several sequences.

As with Metal Gear Solid, the cut scene music includes orchestral and choir
pieces, while the in-game soundtrack is scored with ambient electronic music.
However, the score as a whole incorporates more electronic elements
(particularly breakbeat) than its predecessor, in order to reflect the plot's
thematic thrust of a machine-dominated society. Rika Muranaka again provided a
vocal ending theme, a jazz track entitled "Can't Say Goodbye to Yesterday", sung
by Carla White. The game's music was released via 4 CDs: Metal Gear Solid 2:
Sons of Liberty Original Soundtrack, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty
Soundtrack 2: The Other Side, Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance Limited Sorter
(Black Edition) and Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance Ultimate Sorter (White
Edition).

 Release history

 Original version

The Japanese release was held back two weeks following the initial American
release. As a result, the developers added new features and cut scenes,
including two new modes: Boss Survival and Casting Theatre (the latter allowed
players to select cut scenes and change the character models used). Like the
original Metal Gear Solid, a Premium Package of the game was issued in addition
to the stand-alone version. The box came with the reversible cover art on the
DVD case, a DVD video, an A4-sized pamphlet and a metallic-colored Solid Snake
figurine.

The game's original and fitting European release date of February 22, 2002,
nearly three months after the other releases, was delayed another two weeks. The
added features from the Japanese release were carried over to the European
version, along with a new difficulty setting (European Extreme). In addition,
the European edition featured a Making Of DVD video by French television
production house FunTV. As well as collating all of MGS2's promotional trailers
and a Gamespot feature on the title's closing days of production, it featured a
documentary filmed at KCEJ West's Japanese studio. The DVD was included as an
apology to European gamers for the several month delay that had occurred between
the US & Japanese releases, which saw numerous European gaming magazines detail
the various twists in the game.

 The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2

Released on September 12, 2002 in Japan and September 24 in North America, The
Document of Metal Gear Solid 2 is an interactive "making of" documentary
released for the PlayStation 2. The disc is a database of the game's development
process where the user can view polygonal models used for characters, mechanics
and areas in the game, as well as listen to the game's soundtrack. The disc also
features all of the game's real time cut-scenes from the game (with the no
audio) and their respective storyboards. Other features include a collection of
behind-the-scenes footage, preview trailers, a partial script, Hideo Kojima's
original draft of the game (available only in Japanese), a development timeline,
and a gallery of Metal Gear Solid related products and merchandise. The disc
also includes five "VR Training" levels that served as a preview of Metal Gear
Solid 2: Substance. The disc was included in the European PlayStation 2 version
of Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance, but was not available at retail in that
region. It was also included in the 20th Anniversary Edition re-release of the
original Metal Gear Solid 2 in Japan.

 Substance

Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance is a multi-platform updated version of the
original MGS2 released for the PlayStation 2, as well as the Xbox and PC. The
game contains the main Sons of Liberty game with some subtle alterations, as
well as the inclusion of Boss Survival and Casting Theater modes from the
Japanese and PAL versions of the original game.

The main addition of Substance is the inclusion of an extra missions mode with
300 virtual reality training missions set in a computer-constructed environment
and 200 "Alternative Missions" set in areas taken from the main game. The player
can choose to play these missions as Solid Snake or Raiden, with alternate
outfits for both characters becoming available as the player progresses. Mission
objectives include reaching the goal undetected, target practice, eliminating
enemies, bomb disposal and a set of miscellaneous missions that include
protecting a wounded ally from enemies or fighting a series of enemies. There
are also a set of missions simulating a first-person shooter game.

In addition to the missions mode, there is also a set of "Snake Tales", which
are five story-based missions featuring Solid Snake as the main character. This
includes missions set in the Big Shell area from the Plant chapter, featuring
characters such as Fatman, Emma, Vamp and Solidus Snake, as well as an alternate
version of the Tanker chapter which replaces Olga Gurlukovich with Meryl
Silverburgh (from Metal Gear Solid) as the boss. These missions, which are not
canonical in respect to the main storyline, have no voice acting but are instead
narrated via on-screen text.

The PS2 version also featured a skateboarding minigame based on Konami's
Evolution Skateboarding game. The player can use Solid Snake or Raiden in a pair
of Big Shell-themed levels and has to complete a set of objectives before time
runs out. These objectives range from collecting dog tags scattered throughout
the level to blowing up parts of Big Shell.

Substance was originally released as an Xbox timed-exclusive in North America on
November 5, 2002. The PS2 version was released on March, 2003 and released
alongside the PC version. All three versions of the game were released almost
simultaneously in Europe, the PS2 version being bundled with The Document of
Metal Gear Solid 2 to once again make up for a substantial delay in its release.
Only the PS2 version of Substance was released in Japan on December 19, 2002.

 Reception

 Critical response

As a result of promising trailers and the huge commercial success of its
predecessor Metal Gear Solid, there was a high level of anticipation in the
gaming community surrounding the release of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty.
Metal Gear Solid 2 received a large amount of critical and fan praise,
maintaining a critical average of 95%, marking it the 4th highest game on the
PlayStation 2 and the 17th highest overall at Game Rankings, having sold over 7
million copies worldwide. Game Informer Magazine gave the game a score of 10/10,
and it received high reviews from nearly all major publications and websites.

While critics praised the game's level of graphical detail, in particular the
use of in-game graphics to render plot-driving cut scenes, the title's storyline
was the source of mixed opinions. The storyline explores many philosophical and
cyberpunk themes in great detail, including meme theory, artificial
intelligence, information control, conspiracy theories, political and military
maneuvering, evolution, existentialism, censorship, the manipulation of free
will and the nature of reality. Although some have praised Hideo Kojima's
ambitious script, some even calling it the first example of a postmodern video
game, others considered the plot to be "incomprehensible" and overly heavy for
an action game. Some also felt that the lengthy dialogue sections heavily
disrupted the gameplay, and that the dialogue itself was overly disjointed and
convoluted. Another criticism of the game among fans was that the majority of
the game was played as Raiden instead of Solid Snake.

 Awards

 Comic

IDW Publishing published a 12-issue comic book adaptation, titled Metal Gear
Solid: Sons of Liberty, produced by the same creative team that worked on the
comic book version of the first game.

A digital version of the comic, titled Metal Gear Solid 2: Bande Dessinée, was
released on June 12, 2008 in Japan and is currently set to be released in Europe
on September 26, 2008. Originally announced as a PSP disc, similar to the Metal
Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel, the digital comic was released as a DVD-Video
instead. A fully voiced version of the original Digital Graphic Novel is
included as well.

<wiki_text><![CDATA[Jangchang

The Jangchang, literally long spear, is a Korean weapon first described in the
martial manual Muyejebo from the 16th century. The weapon was preferably made
from the yew tree, but other wood could be used as well, like wood from the
oaktree and chestnut.

The length of the spear was about four meters. Because of its length the weapon
wasn't used to throw with.

 Techniques

In the Muyedobotongji two forms are described to practice with the jangchang.
The first one being jangchang jun chong bo (장창전총보, 長槍前總譜) and the second one
being jangchang hubo (장창후보, 長槍後譜). The forward moving form and the backward
moving form respectively. The way of the movements is also given in diagrams
called jangchang jun chong do and jangchang hudo, where the word do (도, 圖) means
'drawing' and stands for 'diagram'.

Spears were used by the infantry as well as the cavalry.
