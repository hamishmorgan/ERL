Technology
ELECTROSTATIC NANO MICRO CLUSTER PERFORATION or material treatment,
based at micro discharging and sparking, Bluemlein and Plasma Tunnel
effects with gas atomic ionization in Nanosecond time windows. The
pores are normally statistical irregularly distributed in controlled
size ranges from 50 nano up to 80 microns diameter and analogically,
under LASER or MICRO or MACRO PERFORATION, arranged in diameter sizes
from 60 up 200 microns, at best non-inclined holes und hole rows of
diverse arrangement comprehension. For the naked human eye invisible
electrostatic nano or micro perforations may be arranged in areas or
zone bands with specific distances within its web. Controlled pore
sizes in wide ranges from 0.050 to 80 micron diameters by holes
sequences up to 16 million pores per second and 0.1 up to 3 mill Joule
discharge energy for each pore. Process and power electronics patent
grant with DE10328937.

Material treatment, roughness, perforation with nano micro cluster
systems
Web material as regenerated cellulose films, filter, cigarette,
tipping, roll-your-own RYO make-your own MYO, wall, decoration,
transparent, coated, laminate, bag or packaging paper, bonded fabrics,
spun bonded non-woven, food, fruit, medical, under roof house or
agriculture vegetable covering, packs, technical textiles, fabrics,
laminate with base weights from 20 g/m2 to up to 180 g/m2, thicknesses
from 10 up 80 microns, up to 20 g/m2 LPDE coatings are perforate
electro statically nano, micro, or by laser (mechanical with hot, cold
or micro needle) with micro or macro holes for wide range of
application purposes

Performance
Arrangements of zones are usually carried out in width from 2 to 6 mm
and pores density of 15 up to 250 pores per square cm whereas the
perforation of areas results in pore densities of up to 5 million
pores per m2 in surface-all-over design. Electro static perforations
allow porosity levels from 80 to 2,500 Coresta Units (ml/min/2cm2,
1000Pa), equality down to 3 Gurley material web widths from 100 to
2,000 mm at web speeds of up to 500 m/min, depending on porosity and
material consistency in relation to its ability to perforate.

Physical Properties
One of the foremost postulation which can be applied to many
application purposes and products containing bonded fabrics, bag or
packaging papers, non-woven, etc. with gas or steam permeability but
water in-permeability will be found at the application stage of the
electrostatic nano micro cluster perforation. Which means pore sizes
from 0.050 up to 80 microns diameter by up to 5 million per square
meter. This is due to the water’s greater surface tension which
hampers the permeation through the relatively small nano or micro
pores. These and other physical advantages of the relatively small
pores necessarily demand the application of the cluster perforation
method because alternative perforation or processes are NOT feasible,
too expensive or simply uneconomical and would not lead to a
successful application.

packaging, plug wrap, refinish or fine paper

This includes tied cooperation in laser perforation or surface
treatment technologies with Chinese laser manufacturers. The regions
of South America or Europe would also be an attractive option.

Additional starting capital or financial support is not required, but
a functioning, fair cooperation and partnership for the acquisition of
new customers, use of nano micro production technology for the
generation of new product characteristics and improved turnover
figures.

We will be glad to exchange specific information in case of further
interesting.
