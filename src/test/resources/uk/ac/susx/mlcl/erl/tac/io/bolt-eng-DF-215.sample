buyer claims vintage/pre-owned mink headband is dirty~help?
</headline>
<post author="macsmarketplace" datetime="2012-03-09T00:04:00" id="p1">
Buyer received item on February 24 and tonight March 8 I got this message:
"I am sorry, but I just got around to opening the packed and it is alright but it is dirty.And it is to much for something that is dirty, to be putting on my head."
My listed states
"SOLD AS IS AND THERE IS NO RETURN"

Listing also states: it is vintage and pre-owned.
How is it dirty? It sounds like they think they paid too much for it.
What do I do now? I have 100% feedback and never had this happen before.

"How is it dirty? "

How is it not dirty?

A vintage used headband or hat is worn close to the head, and comes in contact with hairspray and cosmetics, it may also have accumulated a good amount of dust and dirt if it was not properly stored.

Did you take it to the Furrier and have it cleaned before you listed it?

Your " SOLD AS IS AND THERE IS NO RETURN" is trumped by Ebay and Paypal's buyer protection policies, so you do take returns and you do refund for a full 45 days after payment is received.

Meowkittykitty - Clearly I'm new here, so can you please explain your rationale? I'm trying to understand for my future sales. Thanks!! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif" alt=";)"/>

Mac - For my own knowledge, did you include photos in your listing?

You can cheerfully refund upon return of item or

buyer can file SNAD, get their purchase price plus original shipping refunded by PP/ebay and you'll get a strike for having a disagreement filed.

btw - when you say "no returns' in listing, ebay considers that you don't want the item back and will refund without return of item.

<post author="meowkittykltty" datetime="2012-03-10T03:05:00" id="p6">
my rationale was explained quite nicely by Desdam. If buyer files a SNAD claim, Ebay will refund the buyer &amp; allow them to keep the item based on your no returns policy &amp; you likely will be negged by the buyer. It is far easier to refund after getting your item back than stand on principle &amp; be out the money and the item.

Pictures are a must. You should have them showing all aspects of the item. When I sold, I would use Photo Bucket to host them &amp; put them in the body of my listings.

<post author="meowkittykltty" datetime="2012-03-10T03:13:00" id="p7">
I looked at your hat listed. Were it mine, I would have pics of the veil spread out, close up of the top, inside, front, back &amp; sides as well as the tags.

The same for the figurines, inside, bottom, back etc. You want to describe your items as if there were no pictures and have pictures as if there were no description.

<post author="poopeyhead" datetime="2012-03-10T03:53:00" id="p8">
Excellent advice Kitty, but I would add that one can't depend on common sense of the buyer either, if a vintage item is not spotlessly clean as it would be in brand new condition then this has to be mentioned also. Just a few lines saying that vintage items may not be as clean or as unused as brand new would do it, as long as you have those pictures. This is what is known as full disclosure, anything else gives a buyer grounds for a return, and these days that is enough to see you refunding a lot. At least if you disclose any condition flaws then you can say it was fully disclosed in the auction and the buyer bid and purchased it knowing the flaws. That is the only defense I have ever known of to work in a dispute but even that is not going to work every time if it happens too often.

Yes, I always post a picture.

<post author="quiltgeek" datetime="2012-03-10T11:32:00" id="p10">
You're not understanding about providing pictures. You need MORE pictures, showing the front, back, sides, inside, close ups of any unusual or damaged sections.

Buying eBay's picture services costs money. You can provide the pictures yourself for free by uploading your pictures to any online picture storage site. Photobucket is a reasonable choice. You can use it for free, or pay a small amount to get more featrues and possibly faster loading time.

To use the photobucket pictures in your Description, switch to the HTML version of your Description and paste the html link photobucket provides under each picture.

Switch back to the Text version of the Description to check how the pictures fit in your listing.

Hello Everybody

There is room for a name on the St Patty tag. I you would like you name on a tag and don’t know how to do it, one of us will do it for you.

Grams, VERY cute Easter tag!!

Rhonda, I LOVE my new tag thank you so much!! I have it saved. I put it on later. I have to get out of here or nothing else gets done. Real Life is such a pain.

Rhonda, thank you and I tubed that shoe.

Rhonda, If you want to try animating I have some easy tuts. I have one that is from the original park tuts. Met made the tut. It was my first animation. I know you can do it. I can help you by email if you want. Kit, Red and Met taught me PSP.

Please check back patiently for your tag, and be sure to let us know you got it. Thank you

Got some presssies, or snags to share great, just post them.

All artists welcome (We all know I need help, LOL)

Got information on PSP to share, go for it. We can all learn together.

Hello Everybody!!!!!!

Hi Shazza nice to meet you. The more the merrier. I hope this thread catches on. I was really happy Grams started this thread. I miss the PSP threads we had at the park too.

Grams and Rhonda very cute St. Pat tags

Grams, I am so happy you liked that tag so much. Thank you for that nice compliment!!

Hi Rhonda, sure I will add Shazza name to a St. Patty tag.

Hello Everyone!!!

Shazza your welcome!!! That is a very pretty thank you tag. You can post old tags too. I post some old tags and some new. I haven’t made a new tag in 2 years, until the past week or two. I had to add backgrounds to the few old animations that I like. They don’t look right and the gray background on the board. Just have fun.

Shazza, Glad you liked them, your very welcome. I always have to double check that my animated tags are saved as gifs, I guess there are some new formats, but I don't know about them.

You did another one, I think you used splash on the drop off for Rhonda on the other thread. Do you even remotely remember the settings?
It has been a long time away for me too.

I have been playing with some filters I never used before. For Rhonda's tag I used Filter Factory N/ Diamond glass, and for Chars it was Visman Distortion Filter/ Gear. They are free filters.

I will try to remember where I got them, and post a link.

And yes I had to do this, just because I'm a bit warped.

OT--Great horned owls hooting up a storm!

<post author="canyon_wren" datetime="2012-03-09T01:33:00" id="p1">
I love coming to the MISC forum on ebay when my insomnia kicks in. Don't usually post, but this is such a friendly board, I thought I'd tell everyone how wonderful it is right now, to hear the owls calling for mates.

I am a wildlife biologist and even tho I know that now is the time that owls start mating/nesting, it's still really cool to hear the symphony of sounds outside my window!
</post>
<post author="meowkittykltty" datetime="2012-03-09T02:05:00" id="p2">
That is cool, I don't know that I have ever heard real owls make noise. I have seen some live owls with handlers &amp; they seem to not like me. One kept staring at me even as it's handler moved away from me. Owls are cool but I am afraid that if one had the chance it would bite me.
</post>
<post author="canyon_wren" datetime="2012-03-09T02:41:00" id="p3">
Hey Meow--

Yes, one of them would bite you!

All raptors, birds of prey, have very strong beaks and really strong talons. In the past I had to capture wild falcons and they do not like being captured!

What is so interesting right now is that the owls are doing their thing, hooting and calling and possibly (having sex?) mating, and most of us sleep through it.

<post author="bostongrammy" datetime="2012-03-07T06:29:00" id="p2">
Give the seller a couple of days to reply. If he does not, then if the envelope did not have any tracking or delivery confirmation, you can file a claim for "Item not received" (INR). If it does show a delivery confirmation, then file a claim for item "Significantly not as described" (SNAD).

hi,it had a delivery confirmation.not sure i understand your other option.i have saved the envelope with the usps sticker on it.never had this happen before,but it seems it must have occured to others.the guy did mail it and all,just didnt use good,common sense in putting a heavy pointed object in a paper envelope instead of a box.thanks again for any advice
</post>
<post author="bostongrammy" datetime="2012-03-07T09:06:00" id="p4">
If the Delivery Confirmation was scanned, then there's no point in filing a claim for 'Item not received" since the seller can show that something was delivered.

On the other hand, your item is invisible or missing, which is not as described. When a buyer files a SNAD claim, eBay will either issue a refund directly or might instruct the buyer to return the item for a full refund. You can ship your empty envelope back to him as a 3-ounce parcel with Delivery Confirmation for $1.64 (if you don't know how, just ask).

thehorseman1955,

As others have said you will not be getting your money back from the seller.

Your only option is to take the envelop, make a copy of the item (pic &amp; description) and head to your local Post Office. You might call first and set up an appointment to talk to the postmaster.

I know that many an item gets caught up in their machinery and it ends up in lost and found section. At, the end of a sort, they find empty enevelops and boxes and items. They just have no way of matching items and containers to each other. So, they will send the container on.

The post master, hopefully, will know the steps in getting your widget back to you. They might need some form of proof of purchase, that is why I say call first.

Best of luck to you.

If there was no Insurance on the package
Nothing the Postmaster can do

I believe others said that if the OP opens a SNAD claim,
They will get a FULL refund
Item price + what they paid for the original shipping and handling

went something like &gt;&gt;

HI, this actually happened to me. I bought a bottle of Avon lotion and the idiot seller put it in a yellow envelop. Well, the bottom split open and the bottle slipped out. I got an empty envelop.

Just file an item NOT as described through Ebay or paypal. If there is a section for a note,write that the envelop split open. The seller was a moron. He should've wrapped the entire envelop with tape to make sure that the item did not bust through. You will definitely get your money back.

This one is the seller's fault all of the way. From time to time, I do use an envelop but I always completely wrap all 4 sides with tape. I add enough tape to ensure that if the envelop splits, the contents will NOT slip out.
</post>
<post author="toybrats" datetime="2012-03-08T16:24:00" id="p9">
Anyway, I filed and the idiot seller never responded to my emails. So on the 7th day, I got my money. On the 8th day, I gave the moron a well deserved negative. Had she responded and at least apologized, I would NOT have posted a neg. Anyway, I am sure that the moron now knows how to pack an envelop.

Item: Digital Zapper AV9f by Hulda Clark, 300670276255
</headline>
<post author="rmhlunatic" datetime="2012-03-03T18:42:00" id="p1">
Seller vilmantasw86 ( Feedback Score Of 206), is selling an "appliance for killing viruses, bacteria, parasites and cancer cells" by Doctor Hulda Regehr Clark.

This sounds like a medical device and is not backed by any science to confirm the claims. In fact, Wikipedia indicates Dr. Clark was forced from the US to Mexico after being legally pursued by the FTC and FDA. In 2009, she died of cancer despite claims her methods, including this zapper, would cure all disease.

It doesn't seem possible to report this to eBay in a manner that allows comment. So, here it is. This device and seller need to be removed permanently.

Recently I have looked at a number of items and emailed the sellers questions....repeatedly in some cases and never got a response.... In 2 cases there was absolutely no way to contact the seller... How do sellers expect to sell items if they don't respond to emails... in years past this was never an issue and when I am a seller I make it a point to answer EVERY SINGLE email I receive... Is this a new trend ??

As you've figured out, some sellers have preferences set to not accept questions, and many just do not answer. Its their choice.

If you are uncomfortable bidding on or purchasing an item without further information, JUST HIT YOUR BACK BUTTON!

<post author="quiltgeek" datetime="2012-03-06T15:31:00" id="p4">
Also - sometimes the fact that the Ask Seller a Question is not on the listing can mean that you've been blocked from bidding. There are automatic blocks that can cause this.

Sellers can set blocks for locations they don't ship to. These can include entire regions of the world, specific countries or domestic destinations such as PO Boxes, FPO/APO addresses, Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico,

Sellers can block for multiple UPI strikes or multiple reported policy violations

Sellers can blocks for not having a Paypal account linked to your eBay account (check this one, sometimes eBay accidently unlinks the Paypal account).

Sellers can block bidders who have one or more current bids on active listings or who have recently won one or more listings.

Sellers can block bidders whose Feedback rating is below zero.

If any of these apply to your account, you might be blocked for that reason alone.

If a seller does not reply to my question with in a reasonable time frame, I do not bid. If they don't have the time to answer, I don't have time to bid &amp; pay. If they simply can't be bothered, how do I know they will ship in a timely fashion?

We shared this name on the boards for a while, but then he got a buying/posting ID.

When I started on the boards they used your email address as your ID so i went by that for awhile. My account got hacked into in order to use my good feedback rating so i had to end up changing in ID. I like to buy and sell vintage baseball gloves and the term for those folks is "glover". I tried glover1 through glover9 and they were all taken so I tried to think of an obscure baseball term I could use and settled on fungo. A fungo is a type of bat used to hit infield and outfield practice. My playing number in high school and college was 8 so i am...........fungo8............but ya'll can just call me fungo.

Most of you may already know, but, here goes.....................

I AM a guy with an ID that one would think as female'

I do lawn care and one of my favorite plants is mexicam heather, which as it turns out, in retrospect probably ended up costing me 500$ because bees LOVE it and ended up with a hive in my garage which cost me 500$ bucks to remove, over 50K bees, largest the guy ever removed.

699 is where I live, close to route 69 in Muskogee OK, I thought heather 69 would give some people the wrong idea, so I added another 9, and still got an occasional remark for the ID.

When I first started on Misc Board, I learned about posting ID's... The thread I posted in most was the local "bar" - posted in the bar frequently was an animation of three sets of eyes blinking in a hole in a brick wall (which I still use today) and people where always throwing peanuts at them. I thought, ' I need an ID, these poor guys need someone to stand up for them' so i became eitw-are-watching (eitw stands for eyes in the wall). BTW, most people call me Eyes now <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif" alt=";)"/>

^^ That is very interesting. I love all the different ID's and wondering how people obtained them andwhat they mean.

Because sellers are failing to file unpaid item disputes, giving him strikes, and/or are failing to use their Buyer Requirements option to block bidders who have excessive strikes.

<post author="quiltgeek" datetime="2012-02-22T15:03:00" id="p3">
Proven bad behavior is not shown in public on eBay. An eBayer who bids and refuses to pay will have UPI strikes on their account if the sellers they stiffed have filed and closed Unpaid Item claims against them.

If you sell, you should have the automatic blocks in the Buyer Requirements section of Selling Preferences set to protect your listings from proven deadbeat bidders and scammers.

Go to MyEbay &gt; Account &gt; Site Preferences &gt; Selling Preferences &gt; Buyer Requirements. I recomment setting the UPI strike block to 2 UPI strikes in 12 months.

OK, if it says NO CLAIMED that means that the email address is wrong OR the person did NOT register with PAYPAL yet.

You must immediately cancel the payment. Resend the payment if you have the correct email address. CHECK The status after you send the payment. If it says UNCLAIMED again, it means that no one is registered at PAYPAL with that email address. You can immediately cancel the payment.

See if you have the seller's email address. Email them directly and find out if they registered with PAYPAL.

Try and make contact with the seller. They are new and probably don't know what they are doing. Be nice. DO NOT POST A NEGATIVE.

See if they are selling stuff. If yes, then you know that their computer works. See if you can email them by asking a question on one of their items for sale.. Or you can also get the contact information and call them.

Don't assume that they are crooks.

Sounds like this is going to get a little complicated. There could be 100 different reasons. I use three different laptops for my ebay business. Two will work fine and then one won't.
The windows 7's work and the Vista won't.

So maybe you need to update Java. Download Secunia and it will tell you everything that needs updating.

Once when firefox updated I had trouble with ebay.

You could even have malware messing things up.

<post author="vermontproducts" datetime="2012-02-29T14:11:00" id="p1">
I sold an embroidery hoop (brand new) to a women a week ago. She emailed me today and said she received it but it is used and has scratches on it. She also said the hoop doesn't fit her machine. In the description, I listed the machine the hoop works with, so I asked her which machine she has. I assured her the hoop wasn't used and that we wouldn't have shipped out a damaged hoop. The only things I can think of is the package was damaged by the postal service during shipping (but that doesn't explain the hoop not fitting), she is lying (possibly a bate-and-switch scam), or she made a mistake and got the hoop for a machine that she doesn't own, so she is trying to blame me for that.

I am going to give her money back, but it makes me mad that this is happening. I do things right on ebay, I know how important it is to receive good products, so i try very hard to make what i ship out the best it can be. i have my main account plus this one that has only 3 ratings so far. if she leaves bad feedback, can i dispute it? this isn't in any way my fault. I ship products safely with lots of bubble wrap.

i can assure you (as readers) as well that the product was brand new and not damaged when it left my home. do i have the responcibility to return the money? please let me know what you think!

<post author="mosaic*madness" datetime="2012-02-29T14:22:00" id="p2">
Make it clear to her she is required to return the item before you refund. Do not refund until you have the item in hand.

Well, I don't think it is a bait and switch. Because your items don't sell for hundreds of dollars the way a Laptop would---for instance. So why would she take the risk of sending ou back a different prorduct?

She MIGHt be hoping to intimidate you into giving a refund without a return---because your feedback is so low---she may think you inexperienced---and do not know the rules.

You can of course, require a return at her expense---but that may well result in a Negative. It's too bad we can't look at her buying History---but you said she is new.

<post author="garmentvarmint" datetime="2012-02-29T21:08:00" id="p5">

<post author="feistyone" datetime="2012-03-01T08:24:00" id="p6">
You can really drive yourself nuts trying to figure out her motivation for what she's saying.

Its easier to just say 'return for refund' and then move on and not worry about it until you receive the item back.

What's this 'customer''s feedback score?

Are there any indications of previous hassles with other sellers?

Ask her if the package appeared to be damaged or anything to that effect.

I once purchased a dress and for whatever reason, the package didn't get me on the first attempt. After several exchanged messages, the seller sent it again, and by this time the outside package appeared to be cracked and bent; but the dress was intact.

So I guess I was lucky on that occasion.

She claims the item is used (which it isn't) and that it doesn't fit her machine. She told me which machine she has and it isn't listed in the description. She said she is keeping the hoop and selling it to her friend (can't be that badly damaged if her friend wants it!)

She left neutral feedback and said the item wasn't as described. It was EXACTLY as described. She didn't read the description.

She probably won't reply to my email. At leats neutral feedback doesn't hurt my rating.

<post author="vermontproducts" datetime="2012-03-01T20:21:00" id="p9">
Even if the damage wasn't my fault? Any damage she claims happened in shipping.

She left neutral feedback. She keeps making different claims. The first was the item was used, second it was scratched, third it didn't fit her machine. The item was brand new, any damage occured during shipping, and she should have read the description before buying.

She probably won't reply to my last email. There's nothing I can do at this point, however I will reply to her feedback.

I was in mail order for 25 years and think people put far too much faith in Feedback. I've got several hundred Feedbacks. So far I've got 100 pos., but I fully expect to get an occasional negative along the way. Likewise, I don't care if a person I deal with has a couple of negatives. So long as they aren't for dishonesty.

You can get negatives reversed. I've done it. Just keep all your e-mails &amp; other paperwork and tell the truth when you dispute any negatives. So long as it appears you made every effort to treat the customer right you shouldn't have any trouble getting it reversed.

A slight correction to my above post:

I should have said "100% positive" rather than just "100 pos.". As Maxwell Smart, the originator of the term "Sorry about that" would say, "Sorry about that.".

Dandy, I remember when we were talking about making soap. There is a gal who makes creams and soaps, and I will remember her name. She had a baby who was a preemie, and all of us prayed for that dear baby to survive.

She did survive, too and I'm just blanking on her name, but someone will know who I'm talking about. Barri will know for sure.

I think her nickname was or is lala or something like that. She had her own thread about the baby and gave us near daily updates.

Oh, this thing with the guys throwing things out.! My dh is a fiend when it comes to stuff like that.

He has thrown away so many things that were important notes to me. He's so fastidious he will tear a page of a tablet out if something is written on it because it's been used.!

It's been used by me, and I wanted to keep that page. My memory is terrible, too, so I write notes for a reason.

When we were doing the making soap thread I was telling about when my current hobby was making soap. My soap was made with lye.

I made some soap, and it worked just great, but, I was so afraid of the process where you pour the lye in cold water that I quit making it. The lye would get so hot the cold water would start to act like it was boiling. The fumes were bad, so I would put it far away from anything.

Ah, I have had so many hobbies, and so much fun with them.

Now I just buy my soap, but, really my sd sends me the hard milled soap from paris. Spoils me a little bit.

seriously,xtreme,you should bug her about it! so many of us have skin issues,or allergies,we NEED good soap makers we can trust!!
for example,i'm close to lethally allergic to coconut in any form.most commercial soaps that use oils only say"tropical' oil,that can be just about anything,you know?
and i would KILL to find someone who makes a decent,no scent,no preservatives dandruff shampoo for curtis,most of them blister his skin.

She does use coconut oil in the soap, but said she'd be willing to try it without it.... and she was wondering what your symptoms are of the coconut allergy... because she has another customer that is highly sensitive to soaps and was wondering if he has the same allergy.

still trying to get her to sell on Ebay... but she said from what she saw in the listings... nothing sells. I told her word of mouth on the boards is a great thing!

Hi Everyone...I am 'The Sister' who makes the soap. I have not tried to sell it on Ebay b/c I didn't think it would sell very well. I've done some research and it always seemed like homemade soaps didn't sell or went very cheaply. I do have soap available for any of you who are interested in buying. Not sure how this works...do I list it on Ebay or can you just email me directly?

I've been reading thru all the postings here and just wanted to mention about soap making: when you add the lye to the water you have to do it SLOWLY b/c it causes a chemical reaction which generates heat. Too fast can be dangerous!!! AND always always always add the lye to the water not the other way around or it could blow up in your face.

hi shelley! i'm bear,with the coconut allergy.
the first symptom is that my forehead starts to itch,then my lips start swelling.when that happens it's off to get an adrenaline shot,or i get hives inside my throat and it closes up.
i almost died when i was 18 because of this.thankfully i was in the hospital already,had just had my appendix out. i ate an almond joy,and within about ten minutes i was swallowing convulsively,my lips wer gigamtic,so was my neck. i couldn't breathe at all,and they forced a tube down my throat which a nurse breathed into. i went into mild convulsions until the adrenaline kicked in,then they gave me some kind of wasp venom antidote.
this happened 4 times over a year,until they figured out what the allergy was. unfortunately,i am now lethally allergic to any wasp or bee sting,i have an epi for that,but i can't get an adrenaline epi.
i'll contact you soon,if you think you could use olive or maybe peanut oil? no nut allergies,trhanks be,or i'd be allergic to myself,lol!

Hi Bear,

I found 2 recipes. One with olive, canola &amp; castor (which really helps it suds) It calls for shortning for a 'filler' oil. Do you know if shortning ever has coconut oil? I can try reading the label but don't know if it'll be much help.

The second has olive, castor, cocoa butter &amp; again shortning. Most any recipe I find online will have added shortning b/c it's a relatively cheap 'filler'.

I know I could make my own with a little research but it might end up costing more depending on ingredients. Soybean is good but isn't much different than olive oil. The coconut helps make a harder bar so I'd like to find something that has that property. who wants a bar that washes down the drain??? LOL I look into peanut oil too.
</post>
<post author="sineaterdoodah" datetime="2012-02-26T10:22:00" id="p38">
shortening would be fine,it's vegetable based.soy is also fine for me,i'm not allergic to it.
i wonder if lard would work?
</post>
<post author="imabeliever1126" datetime="2012-02-27T11:29:00" id="p39">
Lard &amp; tallow (beef) are both cheap additives if you can find them. I'd have to check with our local butcher shop and see if it's available. They tend to be drying so if you already have dry skin I'd stay away from them. If not we could always add something to counteract it...olive oil is a great one and soy if very much like olive.

Do you want me to go ahead and make a batch? My usual recipe makes 8# but since this will be a new recipe I'll try to make it a couple of pounds at first to make sure it's something you can use...and like. How would you like it scented? Floral, fruity, citrus, other?

I will be making soap this week...in fact I MUST get away from the computer and start TODAY for the other 2 ladies who have ordered ahead of you. So I can probably get to yours by the end of the week if you're interested.

PLUS...this has really just been a sideline for me...to give as gifts and sell enough to cover expenses. Suddenly this week I've had more interest in my soap than ever before (not just form you guys!). This may become a real business after all LOL

do you have any ethnic shopping close by,like an asian market or a bodega? or a walmart? all carry lard,i find the best price at the bodega,i get a 12 pound bucket for about 8 bucks.
tallow i get from my local restaurant supply,or the asian market,it's a bit more expensive( i'm a chef,who is SO not PC,when it comes to fats,lol!).
nope don't have dry skin except callouses,so i think any of your choices would work for me.
as to scent,i'm allergic to many,but i like and can wear stuff that smells like water,or grass,or baby powder.
i'm definitely interested in seeing how a small batch works,thank you so much! i'll email you later for prices,okay?

We are dairy farmer in the country...the closest thing for me to check is the local butcher shop...which I happen to be passing tomorrow. If no luck I'll have to get you to ship it to me for that price!!! We do have WalMart but never noticed lard...but then again I wasn't looking LOL

BTW...do you have any Indian markets near you? I'm looking for Amla aka Indian Gooseberry as a natural treatment for my dibetes. I'd like to try the powder or the dried berries themselves.

As for scenting the soap, I use mostly essential oils which are all natural. Not that you couldn't be allergic to them, but chances are the cosmetic fragrance oils would be worse. I'm going to try a small batch and scent it 'Hint Of Rain'. This is rosewood &amp; lemongrass but reminds me of the smell as a rain storm is blowing in.

Sometimes I will rearrange it to go from light to dark, or which I like the most to the ones I like the least. Or by the pattern. All the cat ones have their own very special holder.

The reason I was asking is that DH got some soap from that exchange. Whomever sent the package had a sister I think that made the soap. DH loves it and wants to order more but tonight was trash night and the label from the soap accidently got thrown away!

The soaps came in a cellophane bag with a wooden tray for the soap to sit on and each had a paper label. The soaps were oval in shape but flat and had a white paper label with the contact info.

Why do sellers mark up their items to prevent return?! Whats the point!
</headline>
<post author="sonatural1982" datetime="2012-02-29T06:18:00" id="p1">
I've been a seller on eBay for probably around 5 years, before all of my email accounts, bank account, and my ebay acct., among others, were hacked by someone in Australia. I primarily sold, and honestly never really paid too much attention to other sellers practices, and how they sell their items etc...After all the hoopla with my accounts, I decided to open another ebay account, but not really to sell, at least not at the volume I used to. So now that I buy mostly on eBay, Ive noticed that a LOT of sellers mark through tags on clothing, luggage, purses, even SHOES to "prevent the buyer from returning the item to the retail store". Can someone PLEASE tell me the point in this frivolous action?

Most stores dont operate like Walmart, randomly giving out returns for items that are ages old and without any kind of proof of purchase. Most stores will not even give you a return without some kind of receipt, and if they do give you a refund, its for the "present" value, which wont be worth it to the person whose trying to return an item. You mark up items that 9/10 will not be able to be returned to the store, and more importantly, WHO CARES IF THEY TRY AND RETURN IT TO THE STORE?? How is this a reflection on the seller if the person who BIDS and WINS, AND PAYS for an item you had up for auction meanders to their nearest N.M or wherever to tries and return something? High end stores in no way are going to return an item that does not have a receipt. Try taking a Burberry bag to the nearest store w/o a receipt, and see if you have any luck returning it. It aint happenin. So why the helk would you intentionally mark up beautiful clothing and shoes or luggage with a big black permanent marker because you somehow, heroically, want to try and prevent some pathetic person who is going to try and make a few more bucks then what they paid for the item by returning the item? It doesn't make any sense, and honestly, for me, it makes me not want to buy their items when I see a huge permanent marking slashed trough beautiful leather tags...it makes no sense. I could understand if eBay was like Etsy, where every item is "supposedly" an original, and buyers attempt to resell it as their own. That's a whole different story all together. But for me to mark through a $700 pair of Burberry shoes, so I can prevent the person who paid $550 for it at my store from returning it, makes not a lick of sense. Who are you trying to protect? Burberry..or whoever? Yeah, I think there good without your "assistance".

Sellers out there, PLEASE tell me why do this. WHY?..there has got to be a better explanation from someone than "we are trying to prevent buyers from trying to return items that multi-gazillion dollar retailers made so they can attempt to make a few more dollars than they paid for it in my store." See how ridiculous that sounds?

Most of the high-end stores around here do accept returns without a receipt. They will give you a mechandise credit or an exchange card, not cash.

I've never encountered a listing where the seller marks the tags but I have purchased some items that were marked before they were in the seller's possession.

Why is it so very important?
</post>
<post author="fuzzface50" datetime="2012-02-29T06:51:00" id="p3">
It's not the sellers. It's the retailers that drop the stuff off at goodwill or some other place, so they don't get it returned back to them.

During the Christmas season, I sometimes help out at the Target distribution center for 6 to 7 weeks. Anything that falls off the conveyor belt is automatically put in a goodwill pile just in case it got damaged inside. We then mark GW 2 or 3 times over it and/or either run a line thru the barcode or cut it off completely, depends on the item.

Walk in any thrift store around here that got clothes from a regular store, the tags are all crossed out.

Whether we say high end stores will take it back is here nor there. I dont know the return policy of every store, and Im sure most dont. The ones I have dealt with are not taking back merchandise not purchased from there store without full documentation and proof of purchase. Its so very important because I dont want to spend hundreds of dollars on an item only to have it slashed up with black permanent marker. It takes away from the item. Yeah, It matters. If others want to spend a bunch of $ on items and have it marked through, then that's their prerogative. Im not one of them, and Im sure Im not alone.

Do you leave the tags on the item when you wear/use it?
</post>
<post author="feistyone" datetime="2012-02-29T09:05:00" id="p6">
The manufacturer often requires liquidation merchandise be marked or the label cut/cut out before it can be resold. Nothing the seller can do about that.

Although many stores have tightened their return policies, at one point some would take back just about anything no matter how worn and without a receipt. That is why the requirement was put in place and I think it just stands to this day.

I try to mention if I have something that has been marked or the label cut, but not all sellers do. If it is that important to you and the seller doesn't say, just ask them. That way you'll know.

Ebay is a secondary market, not retail, so there is no point in trying to buy things on here that you can return to a retail store for a full value refund. Retail stores mark through the original tags on items they are selling at clearance or donating, this is done to show the item is no longer being sold at full price and to prevent exactly the practice your talking about, which is someone paying very little on the secondary market and then getting a full value refund on that item by returning it.

So, let me get this clear, your mad because you cant' rip off retail sellers by returning items you buy on Ebay for full value? Wow!

green,

A lot of folks get a posting ID so no one will mess with their auctions. It sounds bad, and it is when it happens but sometimes someone will take offense to some thing someone says and do something to sabotage them as a seller. The chosen defense against that is to have a different selling ID and most consider it the smart thing to do just as that ounce of prevention, but it's not demanded or anything.

I have 3 user IDs.

1) Store open for 11 years, it has taken its own direction and doing very well. Whenever I try to add something else, the items did not "mesh" well with my customer base.

2) Store #2, only sells the other items that would not sell in my main store. Now they are doing very well.

3) Now it has been to post and attempt to help. (will start using it to BUY only, sometimes I can pick up items cheaper on ebay and then resell.

So that's why I have acquired so many.

yet when I go digging back in my PayPal, it shows payment was cleared and that it is okay to ship. I really wish ebay would fix that problem.

What's involved in closing a dispute?
</headline>
<post author="pasde2" datetime="2012-02-18T16:35:00" id="p1">
Backstory: I'm the buyer, didn't receive the item I had purchased, an unrelated item arrived (USPS) with a label that was clearly marked from the seller to me. The label, however, had clearly been cut from the wrapping of a different package - the label itself had had a section sliced off, and some of the original package's wrapping paper was still attached to it. The label also had a USPS sticker (on the underside!) saying "Sorry for the damage." The package itself was not damaged.

I contacted the seller and suggested that he might have mislabeled two parcels that were being sent at the same time. It took several attempts to get him to respond, and at that time he accused me of any number of crimes from lying and stealing to scamming and attempting to commit a felony using the USPS, and said he would NOT accept a return since I had obviously substituted the contents of the package, had definitely received the item I ordered and was obviously attempting to extort a second item.

Sigh.

I opened a dispute as there was clearly no chance that I would ever get any civilized communication from the seller. That's in progress but I am investigating the possibility of closing it, and focusing my personal efforts on tracking down the person who was meant to get the parcel that DID arrive at my address. Just call me Sherlock...

Meanwhile, I've been talking to some people who work for the USPS - all of them were of the (informal) opinion that the two packages were mixed up at the sorting center, labels came off or were removed, labels were then stuck back on some parcels but not necessarily the original parcels, and that (a) it happens frequently at large sorting centers, and (b) just for my own information, many USPS staffers are aware of this and do not use their own service for packages - they always use UPS or FedEx instead.

So - as much as I dislike the seller's attitude and behaviour towards me, I actually believe him (about having sent the correct item originally, not about my own criminal tendencies, lol). Of course I am sad that he now has my money and I do not have my item and will have to look for another one elsewhere and purchase that, but knowing how many of my own packages have disappeared at USPS sorting centers over the last couple of years, I don't want to be unfair and continue a dispute when I think the seller IS telling the truth.

Can someone tell me about the dispute-closing procedure? It seems that I already made a mistake by filing the wrong sort of dispute; I'd like to avoid making another mistake when I close it. I'll be grateful for any and all advice, thanks!

The USPS actually tells you not to cover the entire label. They don't want tape over the barcode. It can (not necessarily will) make the barcode unscannable.

"I am investigating the possibility of closing it, and focusing my personal efforts on tracking down the person who was meant to get the parcel that DID arrive at my address."

Do yourself a favor, don't close the case.

You're just opening a bigger can of worms...

You do not have the tools necessary to find out who the package was supposed to be shipped to, and on the off chance you actually do find out, what makes you think that they'll exchange the packages with you, that is, assuming that they received your item.

Actually, you're assuming a lot...

1. That the other buyer received your item.
2. That the other buyer will believe you.
3. That the other buyer even exists.
4. That the other buyer isn't interested in keeping what they received.
5. That the other buyer will pay the postage to exchange the package.
6. That the other buyer wiil actually forgo opening a SNAD complaint, instead opting to believe a total stranger who has nothing to do with their transaction.

If you filed an Item not received dispute, call either Paypal or Ebay and see about changing it to a significantly not as described (SNAD) complaint. If you originally opened a SNAD complaint, you opened the correct one.

It doesn't matter if you believe the seller is telling the truth or not, you did not receive the item you purchased, and the seller is the one who is responsible for that.

<post author="pasde2" datetime="2012-02-19T06:19:00" id="p6">
Thanks for the input! I'm good at detective work and have actually identified the source of the mystery package.

You're so right, it's complicated. But actually my assumptions are very limited - I't's my habit to work with facts (whenever possible) instead. Here's my own list of assumptions:

1. That I didn't get my item (fact).
2. That the seller refuses to work with me or even to communicate with me, after his initial blast of abuse (fact).
3. That the seller has horrible communication skills (QED) and appears to have a lifetime supply of nasty assumptions (QED), but actually did package and send my item (ok, assumption).
3. That the package's label came from the package sent by the seller to me (assumption) but was detached from that package and put onto another one by the USPS whilst the parcel was in transit (fact - QED).
4. That the seller did not mix up the packages (follows logically from #3)
4. That the parcel I received originated with a grandmother and was on its way to a very young grandson (fact - I did actually manage to locate both the sender and the (father of) the intended recipient, thanks to some small hints in the package itself and some very good detective work).

I make no assumptions regarding the whereabouts of my item. Since the seller will not work with me, I cannot force him to make a USPS insurance claim or even request that he begin a search; even if he were willing to communicate and willing to initiate those proceedings, I wouldn't assume that the original item would show up anywhere, much less be sent on to me.

I do NOT expect that I will ever receive my item (assumption based on conversations with USPS employees).

The item is probably in Atlanta by now (assumption based on conversations with USPS employees).

As for the dispute, I am thinking hard about your undoubtedly excellent advice to allow it to play out and simply avoid any potential "Whoops, can open, worms everywhere" situation. However, I still hope that there will be some point at which I can make it clear to whomever is concerned that I am now quite certain that the non-arrival of my item was NOT the fault of the seller. He is also (as I understand the rules here? please correct me if I'm wrong) probably NOT responsible according to eBay, since I apparently filed the wrong dispute and cannot find any way to change that).

Thank you again; you've been very kind. It's a shame that eBay Customer Service doesn't seem to be a very good source of information, and it's wonderful to know that there are people like you who are willing to explain, describe, advise, and generally be so very helpful to others. THIS is what I love about eBay.

<post author="pasde2" datetime="2012-02-19T16:50:00" id="p8">
I apparently opened the wrong one - I selected "Item not received" because although the label was correct the contents of the package were a mystery and completely unrelated to my order. In fact, it took several days for me to connect an eBay seller with the return address since I had only dealt with him this once and hadn't looked up his name or address. Apparently anything that arrives - empty envelope or elephant - counts as "the item you ordered" as the postal indication that a parcel reached you is all that matters - of course it doesn't indicate whether the parcel was the right one! But in this case, as I said, I believe that the seller did initially send the correct parcel, it's just that it never arrived here.... but alas, the label did.

What I would like to do at this point, I think, is just have done with it all; nothing I can say or do will convince the seller that I'm not a criminal, but that really doesn't concern me; I've been told by some several people that I will automatically lose the dispute in any case as I ought to have filed one that says "Item not as described." I guess it's the rule here, but it still cracks me up - I'm imagining how it would fly if someone went to McDonald's and ordered a cheeseburger and fries and a Coke, then was given a paper bag containing a cup of coffee and an apple pie. Which reaction would seem more natural to you, (a) "Hey, excuse me but this isn't my order - I didn't get my order, is this someone else's order?" or (b) "Gosh, my cheeseburger and fries and Coke look very strange, in fact I do believe that they are not as described!"

Perhaps I'm too easily amused, but I have to comfort myself somehow for (probably?) losing the money I paid for the item.

Of course you may ask, and YES, UPS will be at my farm tomorrow to pick up the parcel containing young Max's birthday and Valentine gifts. His "Oma" was apparently very anxious because her gifts appeared to have been lost in the mail. Max is only one year old so I strongly suspect he has not been moping around the house worrying about his prezzies; I expect he'll just enjoy his special "extra birthday" when the parcel arrives.

Tracking down Max's family was fun, actually; I've asked them to send a photo of Max with his goodies.

And thank you, but I don't think that's being awfully nice, I think it's being a reasonable human being. Who wants a little child or his grandmother to be disappointed, and who WOULDN'T try to prevent that if the opportunity arose?

LOL! I will most certainly be an eBay buyer, probably forever. I love eBay. I've watched it grow from a small, experimental group to a huge and wonderful community. I have "met" so many nice people through eBay - yourself included!

One seller having a tantrum won't change that, and I know perfectly well that any one of us can have a bad day or a series of bad days until we just snap and explode in someone's direction. I'd love to claim that I never have bad days or temper tantrums myself, but if I said that, my nose would grow!

Hi - you kindly offered some advice, so if I may impose on you once again...

I've just been contacted by eBay - a form letter re the dispute:

Hi pasde2, Your case is open, and we wanted to check in with you to see if the issue has been resolved.
We encourage you to contact your seller to work things out. If you were able to work this out with the seller, you can <a href="http://res.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ResolveCPSCase&amp;event=response&amp;caseId=5014756951&amp;claimsRespOption=8?&amp;ssPageName=ADME:X:CPSNSRB:US:1497">http://res.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ResolveCPSCase&amp;event=response&amp;caseId=5014756951&amp;claimsRespOption=8?&amp;ssPageName=ADME:X:CPSNSRB:US:1497</a> in the Resolution Center.
If we don't hear back from you by Mar 15, 2012, we'll assume you've worked out this issue and your case will automatically close.
You can view the details of this case in the Resolution Center.

Needless to say, I've heard nothing from the seller since his initial vent.

What is your advice at this point: Which of these options should I pursue:

A. Should I contact Customer Service and attempt to change the name of the dispute from "Item not Received" to "Item Significantly Not as Described"?

B. Should I attempt to contact the seller one more time (and stand by for another blast)? I'm really not sure what he can do; since his label arrived at my house and he's already got the money, he has no incentive to pursue this matter at all.

C. Should I just close the dispute or allow it to die on the vine (March 15 is the cut-off date, it seems)?

Obviously I won't be able to leave good feedback for the seller, given his response to my attempts to contact him, but I can leave no feedback at all, which at least won't damage his reputation.

I'm out the money, of course, but it seems clear at this point that the fault lies with the USPS for exchanging labels, or at least removing THIS label from the seller's package and attaching it to a different package in transit... and it also seems clear that there's nothing to be done about THAT.

What's the fastest and cleanest way to end this? I'm not prepared - insufficient time and energy - to take on the USPS. The resolution process offers a very limited number of choices. How can I put an end to the dispute if I cannot say "The item has arrived" (because it hasn't and won't, unless the seller sends a replacement) or "The seller and I have reached an understanding, let's just stop this now" (can't really say that either, as my single communication from the seller offered threats if I should try to contact him again).

Thanks again - all of this seems unduly complicated, but perhaps situations like this one are rare... I can only hope so.

well,since you have decided to send the items to max(which IS very nice of you,in these days of being all about"ME"),you no longer have anything to return to the seller.
if it was me,i think i would send one last email to the seller,stating that you sent the items to the correct customer,and he should feel free to verify that with"oma",so he can stop thinking you are a bad person,since you obviously aren't.
maybe tell him that you are choosing to allow the dispute to close on its own,so his rep will not be harmed,and that you choose not to leave feedback for the same reason.
if the seller is a reasonable human being,he WILL check it out,and attempt to replace your item,or give you the appropriate refund. i wouldn't hold my breath on that,though. no offense to the seller meant by that!
unfortunately,there ARE alot of scam buyers,AND sellers here,and they all hurt ebay's rep as well as all of ours,you know?

<post author="pasde2" datetime="2012-02-21T19:16:00" id="p14">
NOT a frightening amount really - a grand total of $41 for a 16"x12" therapeutic rocker board! My mother recently had knee replacement surgery, and her formal therapy sessions will end this week; I want her to be able to continue working on her balance. I wanted this rocker board but I'm just about to start an eBay search for another one - it's not the end of the world, and the $41 is really just enough money to make me feel annoyed about losing it, but not enough to rationalize having an enormous hissy fit and wrecking a new seller's reputation.

After several years of looking after ageing and ailing parents, I have a different perspective on things - I've learned (I hope) to save my physical and emotional energy for things that are really important. On the "important/serious" scale, a non-arriving item and a bad seller just don't even come close to, say, Alzheimer's or cancer, and I've been dealing with both of those, hence the new perspective. Plus, I think I've been spoiled for many years, dealing with so many extremely nice eBay sellers. The law of averages probably applies here - I'll bet I was "due" to run into a different sort of seller.

And LOL re the invoice - for all I know, perhaps the seller did include one with the item! If he did, at least whomever ends up with that package will know what the item IS. The purpose of a rocker board isn't intuitively obvious unless you're a physical therapist or a ski instructor or a serious gym rat... I am now wondering whether someone somewhere is trying to figure out what on earth it is. A tire chock? A dog toy? A detached segment of some much larger and more complicated object? What will some future archaeologist think?

And speaking of silly ideas and archaeology (which I was, even if you weren't), I can highly recommend a book called "Motel of the Mysteries" - it's dead funny. If you ever run across a copy, give it a quick read. You won't be sorry.

<post author="pasde2" datetime="2012-02-21T19:24:00" id="p15">
Ah well, the seller didn't want Max's prezzies anyhow, and had already informed me that he wouldn't accept anything I sent, as it would be something I had deliberately put into a box to "return" to him for the purpose of defrauding him (somehow?). Oh, well.

Your suggestion re sending him one last e-mail is well taken; I may do just that, but poor "Oma" doesn't need to come into it. Max's father, perhaps... but it's probably not worth dragging anyone else into the unpleasantness. One thing I learned long ago is that if someone has reached a position or taken on an attitude for illogical reasons or for no reasons at all, there is NO WAY that you can possibly talk them out of that position or attitude by using logical reasoning. It just doesn't work. And you know the old saying about teaching a pig to sing...

You're right and under the circumstances I certainly wouldn't hold my breath either - I can't imagine that either a refund or a replacement would ever be forthcoming.But it's still just in the ANNOYANCE category, not in the BIG DEAL category.

What kind of awful movies do you sell? I have a terrible weakness for awful movies (this is what a degree in Cinema Studies will do to your brain, you end up collecting very odd films, I won't bore you with the seemingly endless search that finally resulted in a copy of "Pork Lips Now." Who knows, I may end up being a customer of yours! So, seriously, what kind of movies...?

my absolute FAVE distributor is something weird,those guys rock!!! i searched for years for a movie called godmonster of indian flats and eventually gave up. one day my husband threw it into google search to see if the VHS price was any lower,and there it was,for 10 bucks!!!

LOL, we seem to be on the same page about old weird movies, and yes of course MST3K looms large in my legend as well.

I closed the dispute; I believe in cutting my losses and since the money was long gone, the seller was unwilling to help in any way, and the circumstances were just so bizarre that I can sort of wrap my mind around the seller's notion that I'm an arch-criminal bent on dominating the universe with my stolen rocker board...that I never got. Sigh. I'll find another source, but I particularly wanted that one as it had a much larger foot platform than the others I've looked at. Oh, well. There's one out there somewhere! I just hope it's being sold by someone who is courteous and helpful. I think the odds are good, since almost ALL of my eBay sellers have been both.

And now, back to movies... two of my all-time faves (well, apart from the Dr. Phibes movies which are both awesome) are HORROR EXPRESS just because it's SO campy, and then THE WICKER MAN which is still downright scary (unlike its recent, silly "sequel."

A good rocker board is an amazing help when you need to improve your balance and build up the sides of your legs. I've used them at the gym and recommended them to riding students for many years, hadn't ever considered going out and buying one though - at least, not until my mother had a knee replaced. The physical therapists had her using one. It was just once or twice a week for a few weeks, and she was using it lightly, briefly, reluctantly, and holding the parallel bars for security, and it STILL made a difference to her balance. So I'm going to find her one for home use, as she's now used up all her PT sessions.

Now if I could just get her to use an exercise ball instead of a chair...that's another relatively inexpensive FABULOUS item for anyone who has a sore back and is sick and tired of sitting in office chairs. If anyone hasn't yet tried that but has thought about it, I say GO FOR IT!

I agree with the old folks thing creeping up - and we're the same age, heh - but if you're 58, both of the above items can make a big difference to how you feel and what you can do when you reach 86.

And anyway, isn't 86 the new 58?

Angel the bar cart chick was a real sweetie. I did not know she passed away, she was rather young I believe.

Yep, Angel was a nice person, and while I didn't know her well it didn't seem to matter. Angel made the world a nicer place for us all and she is missed.

There have been others on here, and those who while they may not have died have passed on from here just as effectively since they no longer share this part of life with us anymore...sad that.

Angel always made me a cherry coke with excedrin in it. Missing you dear Angel.

kitty, that is a sweet memory of Pred. I didn't know her. Who was the lady who made pies? Were they pecan? I remember hearing about those and wished I had ordered one.

Popcorn, I recently- within the last couple of months I think- saw Piggy posting on another board. I wanted to message her and ask how she was doing, but I wasn't sure if she remembered me or not. Plus, my last few messages I sent on eBay seem to have gotten lost in cyberspace for some reason... <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/sad.gif" alt=":("/> We had spoken by messaging several times about some common health concerns, but that was several years ago. I am hoping she is doing well, since I also had heard that she was very ill a few years back. If I see her posting again, I will try to get her to stop in here and say hi to her old friends. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

Yes, Angel was young, and is missed by so many. She was very kind to me as a newcomer on this board and also on Facebook. I remember she started a reunion thread here on the MB not long before she passed away. She was trying to get some of the posters who had left to go to Facebook and other places to drop in here and say hi. She was one of those people who quietly liked to draw people together, without drawing a lot of fanfare for herself. I miss Angel and her barcart on Fridays.

I really miss Piggy. Cow, who passed away several years ago, named her Hammy for her love of pigs. It was I that started calling CPT Piggy, I thought it suited her. She was so very kind to me as was Pred. Yes it was Sass that made pecan pies. Last I knew, she joined the Biddies, a nice group of posters.

Buyer item was damaged in shipping - when to refund
</headline>
<post author="twillobee" datetime="2012-02-23T15:30:00" id="p1">
I just received a notice that one of my buyer's items came broke. This was the first item I sent by regular USPS vs Priority Mail. Luckily, due to cost and type of item, I had it insured. He said it was packaged poorly. I don't feel it was as each item was individually wrapped with packing peanuts stuffing the rest. There was zero movement and it was in a heavy shipping box. I'm also a stained glass artist and package and sell glass items all over the world and never had anything get broke. I know things happen is why I get the items insured. I have no issue giving a full refund, just want to know when and how to show the order cancelled due to item damaged in shipping.

Do I require the item back or at least pictures? I filed the claim with the post office online and they will have him bring it to his local post office to inspect. Do I require the item back? Between selling on Etsy for a couple of years and Ebay, I've never had an item get broke and not quite sure how to handle it as nicely as possible to avoid any bad feedback. I responded to his message immediately and I'm upset this item got broke to start with due to the care in the packing.

"...and they will have him bring it in....." <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/shocked.gif" alt=":O"/>

The bad news is that neither you nor the PO can force the buyer to cooperate in this Claim! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/cry.gif" alt=":_|"/> Ebay does not require buyers to do this.

I HOPE that he will agree to bring item plus all packaging in to the PO for you. And I hope that the PO will take responsibility for this damage. (frequently, they do not. And they blame poor packaging for the problem---and refuse to pay out.)

Now---let's say buyer refuses. You can then ASK buyer to send you a picture, showing the damage. If the pcture is a good one--and you find it believable--then you can send him a refund without a return, without feeling you have been scammed.

But---if there is a strong doubt in your mind---then YOU CAN require the buyer to return the item to you, before you refund. However, keep in mind that he can file a Dispute against you that will go on your Record as a Black Mark. And he can leave you really bad Feedback

Ok---back to Insurance. If buyer does agree to take item to his PO---then you should refund him in full--right away. And you should be the one to wait for the PO payout---if there is one.

You are absolutely right about the insurance. It seems more of a waste. Too much of a pain. I don't do it for little items, just big ticket or fragile.
My buyer sent me pics last night. He actually was a very nice person when I spoke with him on the phone. The box IS damaged on the corner and bottom. I guess the PO didn't read the big FRAGILE printed on the box. I couldn't see how they could have gotten broke. Six of the pieces had damage ranging from major to minor. I didn't want the broken item back, just didn't know the procedure when at the time all I had was his email telling me they were broke.
My buyer wants to keep it since he says he can glue the items back together. It won't be worth anywhere near what he paid (no longer a certified collectible item since broken) and wants a 75% refund (which would be fair since 75% of the items has some damage). The PO said they can do a claim on only the damaged items, however, they keep it.
Will ebay adjust their fees if I did a partial refund? The paypal fee is minor compared to the ebay fee for this item. Paypal hasn't released his funds yet into my account. Shouldn't I at least wait until they release into my account before I jump to refund if I do the 75% refund?

That means nothing to the PO,don't even bother writing it on the package.

I disagree about tnot buying insurance. Always buy it on more expensive items.

If the PO will honor the claim, why why would the buyer think he could keep it? The buyer needs to do the claim through the post office, thats what the insurance is for. Why would you do a full or partial refund? Makes no sense.

<post author="twillobee" datetime="2012-02-25T06:16:00" id="p8">
"The buyer needs to do the claim through the post office, thats what the insurance is for."
I appreciate your comments. I do intend on keep buying insurance on big ticket items, just a pain to deal with.
I'm getting conflicting info. I thought I had to be the one who did the insurance claim since I'm the one who purchased it? How the PO explained it was, I start the claim, the buyer needs to take the package to his local office to inspect. If he doesn't take the item back to the PO, they will not honor the claim. When approved, the claim will go back to me as the seller and I needed to refund the buyer immediately. However, Paypal hasn't made the funds available yet. Can't give him back what I don't have yet. Should be available in the next couple of days since it says 3 days after delivery.
That's what I'm trying to clear up. The pics show the damage to both the box and most of the contents. I do see from most of the posts, that giving the reduction is not worth it (that's what the insurance was for). It'll be either an all or nothing with for buyer.
It's more the exact procedure to make sure I give him his money back in a timely manner and that I'm able to process my insurance claim. PO tells me one thing, ebay tells me another. What I don't want to happen is, I give full refund, he doesn't assist for the PO claim and I'm just out. I seen on previous posts that the buyer shouldn't have to wait until the PO completes the claim since that could take up to 30 days. This was a big ticket item (at least for me it was), where some of my smaller items - it wouldn't matter as much.

Dog food for dog with Bad Hips?
</headline>
<post author="impressgames" datetime="2012-02-23T22:27:00" id="p1">
Sorry for the misc topic, I'm under the impression that this is a place for misc topics.

My dog and family member has hip displaysia. Short of a replacement hip or severe surgury, Glucosomine/Condroten suppliments have helped quite a bit.

Over time I've been feeding him Pedigree+ Hip &amp; Joint canned food and it's been doing wonders. This isn't a plug for Pedigree, just saw the positive effects (and it has been easier than forcing him to eat meds disguised in food).

This past week I saw an ad for a "buy one get one" for Dogswell brand Hip and Joint canned dog food. I had never heard of this brand before, but MSRP is way above my budget. I bought the only 11 cans my store had, and my dog ate up a few already.

Do any members here have a dog with hip displasia? I have all sorts of supliments handy but the glucosime and condroitin in the "cheap" pedigree food seem to help wonders over pills and treats. This new food has about 1/3 more glucosimine and 1/6 more condroitin, but it double the price when not one sale.

I want to buy what is ultimately the best for my dog with price set aside, but will state that Pedrigree+ probably saved my dog's life in the short term. Whatever will make his hips feel better is what I want to buy.

I don't know about the hip problems, but I have a big dog (150 lbs) that has had to have his knee operated on three times, with the last time being a major reconstruction of the leg. The vet recommended a glucosimine supplement and that is what I give him along with blue buffalo dog food.

I do think the animal board would probably be best for getting answers, most here are animal lovers but there they are the main subject.

His mama was a great dane and daddy was a black lab, he looks like a giant sized black lab, but he is really just a big teddy bear dog. He is an unfortunate mix though since his size is huge and his bones took a long time to catch up to his growth. During that time he managed to knock his knee out of place on one of his back legs as a pup and it's been a terrible problem for him ever since, but other then that his is our big sweetie. I called him Riley because we were stationed at Ft. Riley then (a habit I have had for awhile to call the pets names from where they started with us at sometimes). He is getting pretty old now and he has gone gray at the muzzle just lately...I want him to be with me forever but I know that isn't possible...I just hate to see him get old and slow down, but then I am too these days. Anyway, that's my RiRi and probably more then you wanted to know huh? LOL!

<post author="blinky_noddy" datetime="2012-02-20T12:38:00" id="p1">
Hi Ebay friends,
I have a serious problem with ebay.fr. I have been registered in ebay.fr since 2003 and have been a good customer and client. Awhile ago I was about to bid and I was "ejected" from ebay.fr stating that my pseudo and password were wrong. I cannot come in contact with them to complain as I have no access to their website!!!! I am French and live in France. Do you think anyone could have tampered with my information? But why ebay.fr???
Please, if anyone can help me with a solution, I'll be truly grateful. What is strange is that I have access to ebay.com and I thank heaven for that. I have over 14 bids and was wondering how I was going to pay the sellers once the biddings were over.
Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to help me.

In fact, I do get the notifications to my email but if I try to connect to "ebay.fr" I am not recognized anymore. If the worst happens, I'll take your golden advise and go direct to PAYPAL and pay all the Sellers. I have had no negative feedback and my knees begin to creek now!
Ebay.fr has no contact number so there's no way of phoning them whereas ebay.com has a phone number and we have no access.

Was there a bug in their website? Do you think you could just try ebay.fr to see whether you have access and they recognize your pseudo and password?

Thanks so much once again for being of such great help and assistance. Wishing you all the best.

There was an item posted as starting bid of.01 and just 2 hours before the time was up they raised the starting bid to 19.99 can this be done without fairness to the bidder even though they were just watching it to bid before ending time.

<post author="kathrynscollectibl.." datetime="2012-02-19T05:38:00" id="p2">
Didn't happen, at least not in the time frame you suggest.

The sellers option to modify anything on their auction expires 12 hours before the auction ends, so there is no way for a seller to change the description or price of an item 2 hours before the auction ends.

"we were on 12 hours ago and just before we went to bed it was still a penny"

The seller could have raised the opening bid at any time when the auction still had more than 12 hours left. If it's still active and you last looked at it 12 hours ago, then clearly there was still time for the seller to change it after the last time you looked at it.
</post>
<post author="poopeyhead" datetime="2012-02-19T10:12:00" id="p5">
As long as there are no bids a seller can do whatever they want with their item/description/terms up to 12 hours before close, once a bid is placed a seller can't change much but they can still cancel that bid(s) and the auction if they have made a mistake.

Does Half.com take Paypal??

<post author="fungo8" datetime="2012-02-16T12:02:00" id="p1">
Middle child and #1 son has a birthday this weekend and two of the things he asked for waa a book by Tony Dungy and a book by Colt Mccoy. His mother and i first of all had to pick ourselves off the floor from faint then we checked his head to make sure he wasn't in a hallucinatory stupor or had a massive injury causing him to concuss. I then checked his eyes to see if he'd been smoking weed and smelled his breath for alcohol and luckliy none of that was the case..............but i digress.

I purchased him the books on half.com and have had an account there for years but only use it sparingly so i have a credit card on file. I wanted to use Paypal but didn't see the option anywhere.

No, Half doesn't take PayPal. You have to pay with a credit/debit card. You could use your PayPal debit card though.

Can I pay through PayPal?

At this time we have no definite plans to incorporate PayPal into the Half.com site. This means that, for now, Half.com will not allow payment to be made through PayPal. All items purchased on Half.com must be paid for using a major credit card, such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover® Network. Please keep an eye on our Discussion Board, where we will let you know of any changes to Half.com, including changes relating to PayPal.

OK, I understand having a user ID as a seller and a different one as a buyer, but 10, 20, 30+ user ID'S?? I have been harassed by buyers from CA for well over a year. As soon as I block them, they buy from me under another ID. All share an email address. They are very slow to pay and claim that their items arrive broken or not as described. They NEVER answer emails or communicate with me directly but file claims thru paypal. The latest incident was last week. I told them to send the item(s) back for a refund, which they never do. Paypal was supposed to communicate with them on 2/9, opening a formal claim and telling them to return the item for a refund. I called today to check on the status and THEY FORGOT TO NOTIFY THE BUYERS!!! Ebay is slow in investigating all the user ID's associated with this buyer. I'm feeling very victimized. As a 14+ year seller, I feel that ebay should do what they can to help me!! Can anyone relate???.

By any chance is this buyer also a direct competitor of yours? If you have any info showing that he is---you can file a Malicious Bidding Complaint---and hopefully, get this person removed from Ebay. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/plain.gif" alt=":|"/>

Other than that, if he is bidding on your items on Auctions, you can cancel his bids for each ID as they show up. (that is, get rid of bids from California.

If you are doing BIN's, you can add the stipulation "immediate payment required." Then no matter what ID he uses, he cannot tie up your Listing unless he pays.

And do not allow a nonpayer to leave you a Negative---as I see on one of your transactions. Always file an Unpaid Item Dispute against non-pays. If they do not pay within the next four days---and Neg---that Neg is REMOVABLE. You just contact Ebay with proof they did not pay, as ask them to delete that Neg. It may take several emails, but eventually, Ebay WILL remove those. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

I'm glad you mentioned the neg from the non-payer. I fought hard with ebay on that one to have it removed but since nothing "malicious" was said about me, they wouldn't remove. When I wrote the response to the negative, the "buyer" threatened to sue me for slander!!! I finally told ebay to make her stop sending me emails and they did that. I guess it's hard to be perfect with a high volume of business. That's like the guy who breaks into your house, trips on your rug, and sues for damages because he broke his leg!

No, the buyers in question are not sellers on ebay that I know of. Maybe they have other ID's for selling. They are not competitors but apparently buy on ebay and sell to the Korean market.

The nonpayer who gave you that Neg did not have to say anything Malicious to get that Neg removed. I think you are mixing up the two different things I talked about.

Did you file a UID on that nonpayer? If you did not do so---and I think maybe you didn't---THAT'S why the Neg was not removed. You MUST file a UID---and wait four days---and THEN ask for the Neg to be removed. Ebay should have done so---if you filed the UID. Assuming, of course, the the nonpayer did not suddenly pay before the four-day deadline was up.

Item sold quickly for only 2/3 of the Buy It Now price
</headline>
<post author="gerard-anthony" datetime="2012-02-11T17:55:00" id="p1">
I woke up this morning to find an email in my inbox resulting from one of my saved searches, which had been sent 5 or 6 hours earlier. The item had a Buy It Now price of $149. I was determined to acquire it immediately but when I clicked on the item it turned out that it had been sold about an hour earlier, for a mere $99. The only explanation I can come up with is that the seller accepted a best offer, and within a very short period of time.

Is there any way to determine from the ended listing whether that is what actually happened? Is there any other possible explanation? (I've asked the seller what happened but I don't know if he will respond.)

I find it rather weird, as these items typically sell for at least the Buy It Now price he had on it, and often for twice that amount.

Yes, the seller accepted a "Best Offer" less than 24 hours after posting the item.

If you look here it does look like it sold for only $99 but i think that is a glitch, was that by chance the original opening price?

Why i'm saying that is a glitch price because the other site i use shows it sold at the $149.99 bin price on Feb. 11-12 at 17:55:56 roughly about 21 hours after it was listed. Looks to me like someone beat you to the bin price.

So he accepts a bad offer a few hours after the listing has started in case he gets a good offer a few minutes before it expires! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/angry.gif" alt="X-("/>

I shouldn't complain. How often does one get beaten by a lower bidder? <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

Hello, Daniel here an Ebay addict for the last five years or so. Father of two most excellent offspring, Youth Softball Coach, and 20 yr. husband to the boss of the house. I have always enjoyed helping others, especially the disadvanted youth of our country. I am proud to be a C.A.S.A. volunteer and former Big Brother. It is satisfying to help other Ebayers avoid the costly time consuming mistakes we made when we started. It's a big business preying on new Ebayers and hopefully we saved a few from the most prevalant dropshipping/ebook/wholesale list scams out there.

Hello, Sandee here. I started on eBay about 2 1/2 years ago. I had to take a year off, due to a move and other personal reasons. I'm getting my ducks in a row to go back to listing full time again. We have 2 DD's 24 y/o and married, 22 y/o engaged. DH thinks he should be able to retire in a few years (LOL), so I'm planning to build the biz so he can. I'm a babe in the eBay world, but I had my own business for 15 years. 24 booths at one time in 7 states. So I try to answer the biz related questions and the basic eBay questions. (leaving the tough stuff for you experienced guys). I'm really glad I found this board. I hope I can help out someone as much as this board has already helped me. Smile guys and the world will smile back!!!

Great Thread Daniel! I am Judy, I will be 47 tomorrow, my husband and I have raised 6 great children and are now spoiling 9 of the best grandchildren in the world! Right now the only "children" living at home are an ex-son in law, a 26 pound cat, a 20 pound cat, a diva Pomeranian, a bully Rottweiler and a very timid Pointer.
My oldest daughter got me hooked on ebay. I was a Yahoo Auctions seller right up untill ebay started blasting the television with their marketing ads. Then I had no choice but to switch. My Yahoo auctions went from 50 to 100 hits per day to mostly zero! But by switching to ebay we have found a much better way to sell online. We have made many profitable connections and I have made some really nice friends.
Because I suffer from Rheumatoid Arthritis and can not determine how I will feel from one week to the next our sales are sometimes slow. We try to get as much posted as we can during my good days. But having an ebay store has made me feel like a complete person again.
We are in the process of opening up several web sites. We are building a storage area for our inventory that will have special areas for Mail pick up and delivery drop off. This is us preparing for or future!

Greetings to you all. Newt (the back half of JaNewt and by far the better half is Jan). Living near Charlotte in NC. 61 y/o last month. We had dabbled a little on here and sold some stuff for more than we had in it so decided to take the plunge. Now putting the (for now) finishing touches on a more traditional.com site and will be diving head first into eBay in a week or three. 9 grown kids in NC, VA, GA, FL, TX, AR, 13.75 grandkids, and having a blast with it all. GERARD - you certainly picked a challenging part of the business and good luck to you.

What a great post!
I am Renee, 27 years old from Iowa. I just starting in the whole Trading Assistant thing and I am hoping things will work out so I can start my own store, but I am taking it slow so I can learn all the ropes first.
I have 3 kids, 2 who think I am an eBay addict, along with my husband. My TA gig is going well so I got to prove my husband wrong when he said he didn't think other people would want someone to sell things for him. Now that I have a gal who runs a shop in town I stop by 3 times a week to pick things up. YEAH!!! Anyway, it's great to meet everyone and good luck with your businesses!

I'm Terry, a single mom to an almost 12 year old daughter. In 1996, I started a children's music site offering free lyrics to children's songs (initially about 300, now at over 2000). As the site got busier and the bandwidth charges started increasing, it became clear I had to do something to help pay for it, so I started selling a small selection of CDs and tapes (about 15 items). I now carry about 700, all stocked and sold from my home! I initially used eBay as a place to buy antique songbooks for use in compiling my lyrics database. Two years ago, I decided to try selling some of the products I offer on my web site. It was going fairly well, but when the fee increase for stores kicked in, I decided to close my store. However, with an ex who's decided to stop paying child support, I've decided to give it another try in the hopes of gaining an additional income stream. I'd just started working on customizing my store when folks in the stores thread started reporting problems. So I think I'll wait awhile...

Howdy Y'all, my name is Teri, age 50+ ( who's counting-not me). I live in east Texas with my retired engineer husband. Obviously since I'm not to that retirement age yet I needed an additional income to supplement my web development/programming business. Having been a member of ebay since 1999 as a buyer, I decided to give it a try as a seller. Finding things to sell was not a problem as I have managed to sell hubbies old photography items and things from his mother's estate that are all packed in your garage (where my car should be-that's another story). I have learned a lot from reading all of the postings and will continue to learn as I grow in this new endeavor. I wish everyone success!!

Hi all!! I too am Tina, but better known as grammytina. I have 17 grandkids and I'm just turning 50 this year. I have been on eBay almost since it began, first sharing my daughter's ID ( I was never gonna do it myself ). We made and lost money on the beanie baby craze and that made me shy away for a couple years. In 2000 I got my own eBay ID and bought more than I sold until January 2005 when I started getting serious about selling. I still buy more than I sell, but with 17 grandkids how can I help it!! Needless to say, when the grandkids see the delivery trucks they all assume it's for them. They LOVE grammytina doing eBay. I have gone through 3 computers and 2 printers. Still have my original digital camera and first postal scale (got it free when I signed up with stamps.com) I do have a spare scale, camera, computer and printer just in case any of these crash. I used to have a brick and mortar store (ok, truthfully now, I have had at least 15 stores ranging from crafts to antiques). I think I was addicted to starting stores. My husband is much more supportive of my eBay store cause he doesn't have to haul things. He loves going to live auctions and garage/estate sales with me. My grown kids help by dropping boxes off at the post office and stop by Starbucks for me. I am not even close to being a power seller but have gotten to the point where I just about have my auctions and store inventory on automatic. I just check My eBay every morning to see what sold while I was sleeping. I am never at a loss for words and I have an answer for everything (like I tell my kids, "it may not be the right answer, but it's mine"). This looks like a great post, glad I found you while I was searching for something else....LOL....now I am off to search again....grammytina <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/confused.gif" alt="?:|"/> <a href="http://stores.ebay.com/Collectibles-from-Grammytina">http://stores.ebay.com/Collectibles-from-Grammytina</a>

Hi my name is Jesse. I started dabbling on eBay about 8 years ago while I was in the Navy. Too busy to make an income on it. I got out of the Navy, started being an entreprenuer (not eBay) and failed. Got sales jobs made enough to quit and go to school full time. I joined the National Guard to help out with school expenses and was sent to Iraq. Spent that year planning how I was going to live off of eBay when I returned home to my family. Been going strong about 6 weeks now. Been on these boards for about a week. My biggest regret that has been bothering me lately is that I wish I would've collected more stuff while I was in Iraq to sell on eBay. Just had no space for stuff as you might understand.

Hi Everybody!

I'm Amy, 33, from southern Illinois. I'm a stay-at-home(except for Sunday) Mom of 3 girls(twins + one!) My husband started his own auto repair/transmission business and holds really long hours. We decided in Sept that is would be better for our little girls if I stayed home since we lost our great babysitter to college. It actually seems to be more cost effective to stay home than to pay babysitting/daycare, extra gas, more take-out food etc.

I still work for Wal-Mart on Sunday....I've been with them for almost 10 years and just can't cut ties yet. I've been a manager for them since 1999. I am drawing on my experience from that to be a seller on eBay. I love giving people excellent customer service...my motto is...give them more than they expect.

I've only been selling since mid Jan this year and things are going okay. I sell mainly clothing but also items that me or my husband find at land based auctions so, my items vary. I feel that I am much more computer challenged than the rest of you but, I am going to try to learn............

Have a Great Day! More Later!

Thanks for the welcome Judy! I really am computer challenged though, some of the terms that all of you throw around are still foreign to me but, I am learning every day, I guess that is what is so interesting to be about eBay. My big fear is HTML but, I never met a fear that I didn't at least TRY to conquer! I hope I can learn some stuff that I can pass on to folks even newer that myself. And maybe someday, I can learn to make and insert the cute little store ads that each of you have a the end of each post! Oh well, one thing at a time! BTW Judy, yours is adorable! Amy

Anything that you don't understand, please feel free to ask. Any term can and will be explained. If you don't understand the term you won't benefit from the post! As for HTML go to www.htmlgoodies.com they have a wonderful 7 day lesson that is very easy to understand. They suggest you come back each day and on the 7th day you will be able to write simple html, but I was in too much of a hurry so I printed out each lesson and figured it out in one day! I hole punched them and now have them in what I call my "Bible" I also included color codes and anything HTMLish that I thought I might need. I refer back to it often!
When you go to this site look on the left side, you will see PRIMERS these are the lessons, click on "html" when that page opens click on "Basic HTML: Introduction" then just go down the list from there. The whole site is very informative, you might want to save it to your favs!

Hi everyone I just realized I have been around on these boards for a couple of days and haven't formally introduced myself. My name is Rob and I live in a small Town in England called Wem. I am 42, married to Gill and have three Beautiful daughters.( originally I was born in the city of Liverpool) In between trying to scrape a few pounds (or dollars in your case) on eBay I am training to be a Pastor whilst studying for a Degree in Theology. Prior to my call to the ministry I ran a medium sized customer facing business in cell phones... I like you all suffer from what i call " eBayitis"...its great and there is no known cure <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/> I you want to know a little more about me I have two blogs...one all about my experience of eBay <a href="http://www.ebay4beginners.blogspot.com/">eBay4u</a> and one about my life as a trainee Pastor <a href="http://www.shared4u.blogspot.com/ ">shared4u</a> check them out from time to time Rob <a href="http://www.ebay4beginners.blogspot.com/">eBay4u</a> <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

Hello everyone! I'm fairly new to the Internet Marketing and eBay scene. But I'm enjoying it. These online forums have very interesting coversations.

I currently work in the Financial industry, but with all of the mergers and buyouts, that world is very unstable. So, I wanted to start a home business to generate additional income just in case I get "Pinked slipped"!

I just finished an ebook and now I'm in the process of promoting it. That is what caused me to consider ebay.

Hello, folks!

My name is Honey, and I live in Nashville, TN. I've spent my whole life working really really hard to avoid working the 9-5 so I could stay home with my children. I've been a beautician, coupon queen, sales person, bookkeeper, cocktail waitress, secretary, BBS SysOp, etc. I've always loved computers, back before they were popular. I wanted to do web page designing but business websites got too complicated for me to do solo so I just dabble for friends.

Three of my children are living on their own now, leaving only my 22 year old special needs son. My house of 32 years seems huge and stuffed to the rafters with junk (hopefully somebody's treasure). Time to downsize and reclaim some space. I sold on Ebay back when it started and decided to give it another try. It's changed a lot. I don't think its as profitable anymore. Maybe the novelty has worn off, or more sellers setting up stores, or higher shipping costs. I don't know. I'm trying to learn what might work, and a little money coming in wouldn't be a bad thing. Presently living on air! Any hints or help appreciated! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/> ~honey

Hello All!

I'm Bob. I'll refer to myself here as "Bob D" though as I have noticed another "Bob" posting here and I'll give him use of plain old Bob. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif" alt=";)"/>

I've used eBay very little, only for purchasing a few items. I currently own a Brick &amp; Mortar, Pet Services and Retail business. I've owned it for the last 5 years and have grown it quite successfully by providing A+ service, having a friendly environment, high quality products, fair pricing and knowlege of our products and customers.

After a recent buying binge here on eBay, and doing many searches for similar products offered in our B &amp; M store, I decided eBay might be a great way to add to the bottom line. Especially after my bad purchase experience from what seems to be a successful eBay biz. I figure if those knuckleheads can make a go of it on eBay, then I should be able to thrive on eBay with my same ideas towards good customer service, product and pricing. I'm still trying to get things set up, but what I've learned so far is, Auctiva is probably the best way to go about setting things up and managing my merchandise. I have access to 1,000+ items in the pet industry at very good wholesale pricing. Any suggestions regarding Auction Style, Buy It Now etc would be greatly appreciated.

Also, I keep noticing "Bump" or "Bumpity Bump Bump" and "OP" and other things I'm not sure what they are. Can anybody please explain?

Also, does anybody have an average cost per sale calculated including Listing and PayPal fees? That would help.

Great thread and great meeting you all!

Hi Everyone, My name is Liz and I'm a 26 year old full-time student. My fiance (Quincy) and I are trying to start an ebay business to have some second income. Also, I'm planning a wedding for next year so I am in the market for some wedding stuff. We have been selling and doing business on ebay for the last 2 years. We have open a store and tried the business route. The problems we face at the time was the products, not having a steady supplier, and the ebay fees from the feature listings. So most of the income we made was given back to ebay. I think these experiences have taught me to do my research and learn from my mistakes. I am in the process of researching for the right products, suppliers and getting my tax ID #. I'm trying to get things organize so that I keep track of everything. I'm still working on things and I need to change my about me page because it's so old. I came to the boards because I was looking for proof that you can start a business on ebay. I see that it is possible after reading so many stories on the board. Hopefully I will have a success story. I hope to meet lots of new people. I'm open to any feedback.

Hello.

My name is Anita and I am brand new to eBay; just signed up a few minutes ago. Learned right off the bat that you can't email a member here until your account is at least 3 days old, so... I am posting open forum instead. I am a business consultant, and have been for almost 25 years and write a business column for one of our local newspaper here in Alaska.

I wanted to ask Daniel (or any other person who might know) about the e-Book problem he was referring to in the opening post in this thread. Because I write and sell e-Books for self employed individuals and small businesses, (primarily in front office topics and tax loop hole strategies), I want to be well prepared for any problems/questions that I might face in establishing my site.

Any helpful information would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!!

Hello everyone,

My name is Corey I am a 24 year old father of 1, I convinced my wife to start an ebay buisness last year. I have been a big ebayer for a while now. I am as of next week opening a ebay drop off location in Enid, Ok and to increase sales in our very rural setting was thanking of traveling to local town's in our camper and setting up shop for a day there. I am a stay at home dad with our 1year old so I think it would be great.

I am very glad I found this board and have already found some very great info.

Thanks!

Hi All!

I'm Monique and I have been buying on eBay for years, but just started selling last year when I was abruptly laid off my job after being injured.

I am new to this Discussion Board, so I wanted to introduce myself and say how grateful I am that I took a moment to stumble across this board. I just opened my store a week ago and I've read a lot of valuable information so far!

I'm opening a new topic because my problem with selling on eBay seems to be that I am completely unfocused. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/plain.gif" alt=":|"/> I am interested in almost everything and can't seem to concentrate on or commit to selling just a few types of items. It doesn't help that I have experience in and knowledge of a lot of different things as well. I'm a real "Jill of All Trades, Master of None." <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif" alt=":^O"/> LOL If anyone has ideas or can relate, please go to the "Jill (or Jack) of All Trades" thread to offer your input.

Thanks for reading!

Hello, my name is Gene. I've only been on Ebay for a short while compared to most of you, signed up in January, started selling in March. I'm 37. I was born and raised in Southern California (los Angeles area) and I have a full time job building networks for computers, tv and phones in new buildings. It was pretty cool for a while but now as I get older I'm really getting tired of it. (who doesn't get tired of their full time job?).
I've been married to my wonderful wife for *almost* two years now, and (at the risk of sounding all mushy) she has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. My life has really changed for the better since I met her.
I've been into building plastic models as a hobby since I was a kid. It was my mom who got me into it, she used to build race car models when she was a kid in the 50's. Over the years I have built a vast collection of models, I'm talking hundreds and hundreds of model kits. I even had a dream of opening my own brick and mortar hobby shop. Well thanks to Ebay that dream has some new life breathed into it. There are definitely big plans ahead!

<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v695/-floo-/ebay/FLMlogo-White.jpg"/> Its the FUTURE! Where is the jetpack I was promised?
I was looking for a job and then I found a job and heaven knows I'm miserable now

Hello, everyone.

I started clicking through the discussion board yesterday and quite relieved with what I found so far.

My name is Gel, 35 years old. I might have to eventually change my ID depending on what I end up concentrating on.I'm fairly new to ebay and my record is buying stuff since the start of 2006. Now that I'm planning to go selling, I am doing as much research as I could.

I have a very good paying job in Public Relations here in LA, with a big company, but I am planning to quit. It is a highly-stressful job and worse of all, it takes between 1 to 1 1/2 hours for me to drive to work (one way) with a 30-mile distance. Blame it on freeway congestion!

I have a 9-year old daughter and while on disability leave due to an operation, I found out I'm 8 weeks pregnant after years and years of trying. That is a true tribute to stress! I want to have more time with the kids than what it is now.

I thought this is a good time for me start my long time goal of being self-employed. I'm looking at other business opportunities but so far, the ebay concept comes closest to my heart.

It's nice to read what others have to say and to learn from experiences from other ebayers. I'll sure come back on this thread.

I will go to the ebay live convention this June.

Hi all. My name is Lisa and I have been selling on ebay for about two months now, as an extension of my website store, and I am hooked! Sales have really been great, for the website and ebay. Right now I am doing auctions and buy it nows. I sell mostly scrapbooking supplies, dollhouses, miniatures, and some of my artisan pieces that are hard to move at shows. I have written a review entitled 'Choosing a Dollhouse...How do I pick?' and in the last three days it's been up it has gotten alot of great votes...I mostly wrote it for my customers who didn't seem to know the choices out there when choosing a dollhouse kit, and the variety. the link is:

I am hoping to open a basic store, just to move stock that does not sell and have more options......as in stock, or more variety. Still waiting to make the big leap of an additional web store.

Hi all.
NvestNU-LLC aka Kim &amp; Brent
We are a couple team full time eBayers since 1995 from Central IL. We started selling small went big with a drop off store and partners. Partners big mistake. Now we are back to being small again. What a beautiful way of life. Helping others sell their stuff and enjoying each other. We have learned from the road of hard knocks. Tried many programs and have been taken for a lot of money. We are very willing to share DO's and Don'ts with anyone needing input on opening a drop off location, consignments,programming programs, or being trading assistant. It is a great world we live in. Our favorite saying is "We all fall down sometime. It is how you get back up that counts. Get Back Up.
Love God, yourself, treat eBay as a business and the rest will take care of itself.
Thanks for reading my ramble. Brent NvestNU-LLC

Hi All, My name is Erin and I am starting a new ebay business called Lady Abigail's Collectibles and Gifts. I will be trying to specialize mostly in animal related items such as plush and figurines, etc. Right now the hardest part is finding wholesale places to order from. Not so much on the plush end, but a lot of figurine places want you to have an actual physical store or you can't buy from them. I am starting out small by just listing auctions and I have not created an eBay store yet, but I hope to soon.

Quick backstory, I have been using eBay since about late 2001 or early 2002 and started out as a buyer, and quickly became addicted! A little over a year ago I returned to an old hobby of mine, making things out of polymer clay, and I realized beads were booming so I've sold a lot of my handmade creations in the past year on here and it's been great. Unfortunately for me, it takes me too much time to handcraft the beads and I didn't see that venture as being able to support me, so I decided to start a business and get into retail. So we'll see how this works out but I hope to find a lot of helpful tips &amp; advice on here. Thanks, Erin

I have done makeup for brides, aspiring models, and for friends who just wanted to do something special for themselves. Recently, I had the opportnity to be the principal makeup artist for a short film shot in College Park, MD. I felt like I was at home. This has been the career I have wanted since I was 12 years old. I am finally in a position to pursue it. To see my online portfolio, click this link (or paste it in your browser address bar): <a href="http://www.face4ward.com/portfolio.htm">http://www.face4ward.com/portfolio.htm</a> To supplement my income, I would like to market and sell the line of cosmetics that I have chosen to feature for my freelance business on eBay. My main concern is how to market my eBay business successfully and how to make products stand out among the competition. Best Wishes to all eBayers! Karen a. k. a. face4ward

Hi All, First posting here so thought I better introduce myself. I'm Steve UK based, married with two children and have been running my own small on-line business for a few years. I got hooked on online auctions in the late 90's and initially ran my own auction site which whilst being fun was problematic. For the last five years I have been creating and offering free auction tools for use with eBay and other sites - these mainly concentrated on the UK market. Additionally I run a few other non eBay related sites and whilst I could probably make a better living doing other things I do enjoy my work and get to spend more time with the kids <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif" alt=";)"/> Anwyay don't want to bore you with my first posting lol so will end it there <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif" alt=";)"/> Please feel free to visit my about me page as hopefully you may find some of the tools helpful. All the best Steve

Hi there, I'm Carrie,
I have sold two different months on bay, things from home and did very well. I just opened a store and am beginning to sell as part-time hoping for full time in the future.
I am a neuro-muscular therapist, specializing in trigger-points....a fancy name for massage therapist who is a pain specialist.
I went into my profession as so many do, because of my own pain from a car accident, which I was able to master and get rid of most ofit in this therapy. I was going to save the world!
I was full force into what I did, do and then the face or reality reered it's ugly head....let's just say the politics of doctors office practice's and insurance billing, left me more than deflated, if not feeling like i needed a shower to wash it all off of me at the end of each day(deep sigh).
Plus, I can only work there part time or my hands scream and I am dropping plates and galsses all over the kitchen in the morning....lol, no grip left.
I think/thought of going back to Palm Beach and doing hair, but it's so gossipy there and through massage I am used to doing my own thing. Talk about slaving....lol. Over there, it's not what you did for me yesterday, it's what can you do for me today attitude, so.....
I considerd ebay and decided to give it a try. I liked selling so much before, it was fun and most of the people I sold to were really nice. So....here I am.
I have already received immeasurable help just back reading threads from this board and I thank you all who are so willing to help with advice. One day, when I am a grown up ebayer, I will help also...lol. The good deed chain reaction thing.
I guess that's what I like about the ebay selling thing, I have no performance pressure, only to myself. And yes, while we are all selling, it's a great-big-world out there, and more than enough room for all of us.
I am sure that I'll run into those extra special challenges <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/shocked.gif" alt=":O"/> (difficult buyers) that I have read about here, but I am thankful I got a nice foundation before the water got too deep.
So, that's me, Carrie or akabombshell at akabombshell's most wanted and yes my store is "so" under construction, so don't laugh.....(Smile) and hello to all!..........................Carrie

Hi All! My name is Trish, I am 47 years old, happily married to the love of my life - who I sadly didn't meet until I was 42. Since we started late we are currently the parents of a 15 year old cat. I am however the doting aunt to 10 nieces and nephews. I ran an ebay business full time 2 years ago and was fairly successful with it. I have worked in a personalized gift store for 15 years and my husband and I bought the store together a year ago. I took a year off from ebay to concentrate on making the changes to the retail store to make it more our store. I've just re-opened my ebay store listing a variety of products that I love from my retail store. I am relieved to see that others are saying business has been a little slow this month (my first month back). This is a lovely forum and hope to utilize the collective knoweledge here. I actually will post a separate question from here. Thanks for the place to introduce myself. And, yes, I am an ebay-aholic. I can't wait for the day that I can sell the retail store and strictly ebay full time again. Trish <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

Hi All, and Happy Memorial Day! I'm Linda, and I started on eBay selling stuff that was laying around the house, like some who have posted here. Soon after I started selling, I was laid off and went to eBay for full time income. I had good months and bad months, but couldn't make my entire living from it. I'm currently working a full time job. I'd like to start selling again, but find I don't have good sources for products to sell. I love to sell CDs. They're easy to list, pack and ship. I'm glad after all this time selling that I found this group. Looking forward to learning new things.

Hello Fellow eBayers! I'm Nan from Iowa. I have had my eBay store NanStuff4sale, for about 2.5 years. I started out posting on the New To eBay Board, and learned all the basics about buying and selling there. For the past couple years I have lurked but rarely posted on the Stores Board. I had always found that board to be friendly and full of information. Lately however, the tone of that board seems to have changed, and I'm finding less useful information there. While I'm by no means an eBay cheerleader, I do think it's the best selling option for me, as the buyers are here. Of course eBay has made changes and "improvements" I don't always agree with, but I'm more of a "this is how it is, how do I adapt" type person than a "whine and complain" type. I'd rather use my energy changing what I can than fighting impossible battles. I love the friendly and helpful upbeat tone to this board, and have done a bit of reading here the last few days. Many thanks to Sandee who I met in my newbie days for leading me to this board, and hello again to Rhinestone who I first met on NTE. Looking forward to getting to know the rest of you. Nan

Hello! I feel like I am sort of official now so I can post here. I have over 50 feedback and opened a store yesterday,..or the day before? I dunno, It has all been a blur!! LOL! I have been a stay at home mom for the last wonderful 6.5 years and have a beautiful son and a wonderful husband. We now live in Texas, moved from Utah 2 years ago now, and LOVE it here! We do not want to move. My hubbie is looking for a different job than the one he has now, but we hope to stay here. I read on e-bay, and try to sell. I haven't listed all of May because April killed me in fees and I spent all my profit on stuff for my boy! LOL! Anyway, I set up the store and need to start promoting it as soon as I get everything listed. I have a lot of inventory. Luckily I am almost done listing the DVD'S! Now on to the earrings!

I became very interested in the idea of selling on Ebay just recently after being a ocasional buyer for a few years. I really just want to make some $ off ebay to get my own place.

Hi Yall.

Well another career, what can I say? Die or go broke trying?
Year late and a million short? Six years being self employed now. I think my ebay store will be the 5th ecommerce venture I've done. I started my first online store (not Ebay) back in 1997 using IBM Net.Commerce. $5K for the software package and $27K for the server plus $750 a month for bandwidth. The good old days when it was easy to make $$$$.
Oh yeah, 2 kids, 2 dogs, 2 cats, too many cars, wife, EX, too many bills.

Hello, I am David and my wife is Judy. We have been Ebayists since January, 1999. We have been selling our main item since December of that year. Before that we were selling Fisher Price toys and anything we could find at garage sales. Our name came from the brick and mortar store we had, in which we sold used blue jeans, T-shirts, baby items and toys. I also work at an Academy for troubled youth. My wife watches 7 of our 8 grandkids and does the shipping and emails (we are both under 50 y-o-a nonetheless!). -----------

I would like to give them a better life than I had, so I am hoping to get this eBay stuff to work for me like it seems to have for so many others. I have successfully sold a few items on ebay prior to my deciding to open a store. And I know the basics. Well, the bare minimum basics. I know good pics sell items, and excellent descriptions definitely help. But I know you also have to be honest and fair and work with the buyer, not against them. Just wondering if there is any other basic advice i need before making the big plunge. Thanks in advance, Jay

Hello everyone!

My name is Dana and I am from Fredericksburg Texas (population around 9600). I am a mother of two cute little girls.(2 and 4 years old) We live out of town on a 32 acre ranch and as a result of transportation cost, day-care, etc. I stay home with the girls and school them. My husband is in the middle of starting his own automotive restoration business out here on the property, plus works full time for the electric company. So, I am trying to make some extra $$ on ebay to cover my shopping on ebay! LOL I have enjoyed it so far and I am working towards power seller status. I also raise miniature dachshunds and actually have a litter of three that are about 5 days old. I have just recently stumbled on to the community board and it has had some great pointers. I am trying to get all the info I need to reach my goal!

It is nice meeting y'all,

Hi,

I'm Debra and while I am new to selling on Ebay, I have been buying forever. My hubby and I have one son who is grown - never mind his age (smile), and we have the cutest apple head chihuahua - Paco!

My Ebay business deals with taking old things and making them into something new and pretty - Shabby Chic, vintage, hand painted - it all applies. Sales are not great now but hopefully it will change.

I am in Louisiana, via Atlanta, Ga.; Tuscaloosa, AL; and Houston, TX. Sounds like we are in the witness protection program LOL.

Greetings,

I'm Mike. This is my first time on eBay. I've been unemployed now for more than 4 months and have not had any luck nailing down a job. (either over-qualified, too old, or not enough experience... who knows why) My daughter has made a modest living using eBay and the internet for over 5 years now. I am giving consideration to the possibility of utilizing the powers of the internet and eBay toward some degree of internet self-sufficiency.

The experiences of others on the various message boards will aid in my evaluation, and of course which "products" appear to be the most in demand.

See you all around.

Good luck to all,
Mike

Hello, Daniel here an Ebay addict for the last five years or so. Father of two most excellent offspring, Youth Softball Coach, and 20 yr. husband to the boss of the house. I have always enjoyed helping others, especially the disadvanted youth of our country. I am proud to be a C.A.S.A. volunteer and former Big Brother. It is satisfying to help other Ebayers avoid the costly time consuming mistakes we made when we started. It's a big business preying on new Ebayers and hopefully we saved a few from the most prevalant dropshipping/ebook/wholesale list scams out there.

Hello All~
We've been on eBay since 1998. I can't believe it's been 8 years! MODDITIES is myself and my boyfriend/fiance/SO/whatever the kids are calling it these days <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif" alt=";)"/> We've been together for almost 10 years. I'm far too young to have a daughter turning 22 this year - but, alas, I do. I am a freelancer in TV/event production. In between official gigs eBay helps make the ends meet. I would LOVE to do it fulltime, but only time will tell.
Cheers,
Shannon (&amp; Mick)

Hi, this is Shari. I have been on ebay for a couple of years, but only in the last year have really started using it regular. I am enjoying buying and selling, but have to watch that I don't spend every cent I make because I am an addict.

I am the mother of 4, a girl and 3 boys. They are 19, 10, 3 and 1. We are very busy. The oldest is in College. The next is very into League baseball, my husband coaches and I am team mom.
We are also very involved in our church.

Hello everyone! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif" alt=";)"/> besides working and volunteering. I'm studying part-time in the night after work.

In the past, few years back no one told me about eBay and no one told me that i can sell online at a minimum cost.
I didn't know selling online is possible for me with budget on hand.
I have to take the initiative..haha
At that time i wanted to sell online but after knowing that would cost me 5digits to do it and then i couldn't move on till few months back, a friend mentioned about eBay and daily heard about him sharing and talking about eBay stuff. I was pushed forward to read about eBay then. I hope to list items soon which enable me to pay for my school fees.
Oh Yah, i'm staying with my parents and a brother, a sister.
Both are working as a full-time soldier and telecom company.

I'm glad eBay is a community for everyone.

Hope my message not too boring
Cheers!

misspixyee, please don't get offended. It's not personal. It is actually for your own benefit to know what the posting rules are before your post gets pulled and you get suspended from your discussion board involvements before they have even begun.

Advertising posts are one of the things ebay really tends to crack down on and suddenly you are suspended before you start. Therefore, I finally just posted that info on a notepad to use over and over. (got to lazy to type it LOL)

I have made a few sales which has been encouraging (my customers have told me theylove my rockers), but I need advice about how to "ramp-up" my sales activity.

We like to keep this board somewhat focused on e-bay, although, I have had my own threads that were definitely NOT e-bay. We do have a weekly?? now guys?? chat thread. Look for that if you just want to chat about your "stuff." Unfortunately it is against e-bay policy to link to a web site where you can buy things that are not for sale on e-bay. Unfortunately.

Hi!

My name is Mike, and I've been an Ebayer since the dawn of time. I live in Des Moines, Iowa, and am currently off of work due to an injury to my back. In my spare time I enjoy shopping and selling on Ebay, and I'm also a paranormal investigator for a group here in Iowa called Diepart.

I kind of fell into the idea of opening a shop here within the past three weeks due to a friend. We were having a garage sale together and she put out some vintage costume jewelry, and all of the pieces were marked at $1.50. I got to looking at them, and they were all pieces that were signed. I pulled them out of the sale immediately, and started doing research on costume jewelry. Much to my chagrin, I'm now hooked on the stuff!

Well, I guess that's about it. I just wanted to say "howdy" and let you all know that I would most likely be butting in to conversations a bit more now than I used to! LOL! Hope to be getting to know more of you soon!

Hello All We have been selling on e-bay for a little over a year. We sell on another site, mostly books and have 10,000 current listings. I am just now finding time to check out these boards, but I do need some info on subjects. I find e-bay a good site to make my summer money as books are not a hot seller through the summer months, so we sell other things. About the beginning of Sept. books start to kick in and then it is all about sorting and posting. I recently bought a 5,000 sq. ft. warehouse and have it just about filled. So I guess you could say that we are going in for the long of it. If you have questions on books contact us and we will try and help you out. And if somebody can help me out with the taxes end I would love that. Thanks Steve

Hi, Everyone,

I'm very new to all of this, but have been lurking over this board for some time now and have really enjoyed the positive spirit generated throughout these discussions. I understand that this is not always the case with other boards, so at least for the while I will stay on here.

My name is Paul (dukeman62), and I am a beginner with eBay, having bought and sold here just a few times--largely for the fun of it. However, my present intentions are to turn this into a fulltime sales venture, initially starting off in the auction format. One thing that I have also been doing, and knowing how very important it is, is to become familiar with all the rules of the game--with much stress on thorough research on all proposed sale items. Because of budget considerations, I am initially using a good free research tool and will obtain my listed items from a very well recognized resourcing company offering an always-current edirectory of light-wholesalers.

I ramble on, but I can hardly hold back from the fun and challenge that I perceive on eBay.

So, thanks for being here, and I genuinely look forward to much interaction with all of you as my involvement grows! See you soon.

Hello everyone! I'm Sandy, an Ebay seller for a few months now, and still trying to find a niche. I live in the Chicago area and love it--except for the traffic! Have been married for 36 years, and we have raised two children, both in their 20's and fairly recently married. We're still reeling from two weddings so close together and so soon after college! I started selling on Ebay after I quit my job of 24 years. Have wanted to try being a seller for awhile so decided to give it a go. And, since I worked with women's designer clothing for a good part of my career, that's what I gravitated toward again. I spend most of my spare time in my garden and also designing gardens for friends and neighbors. I am, however,"technologically challenged", so that is really slowing me down with Ebay! Have been lurking on this board for awhile just trying to get some good advice on building my business. Some of you have so much computer knowledge--wish it would rub off!

Hi everyone! I just started on ebay last month, so I'm still trying to familiarize myself with everything. I'm enjoying the discussion boards because I think you get alot of information from others. I'm not sure yet what I want to do, I know ever since my brother told me to go on and look at this car, I've been hooked ever since. I'm on here everyday mostly and now that I'm taking a stab at the discussion boards, I'm on alittle longer now. I'm interested in doing a couple of things right now, I'm going to let GOD lead me into what is right for me. My husband is a nonbeliever if you know what I mean, so I pretty much have to go at it alone. I'm interested in any advice anybody might have for me in my journey for SUCESS! Nice having this little chat with you all and look forward to meeting some of you. Have a beautiful day! LONI

Greetings! I am a 57 year old guy who, after 25 years as a heating/cooling contractor in Michigan, is looking to have a new business life on eBay and with eCommerce in general. I am currently working for another contractor during the period that it will take to get up and running. My wife and I have modest needs, and while she is still working parttime in the Dental field, we look at this new possibility as a way to move into the next phase of our lives.
I am trying to put together a business plan to convince both my wife and myself that this can work. As a businessman who has depended on numbers to mark the way for over a quarter century, I am looking for someone who can help me put together "real" numbers for this industry. I realize that everyone's business is different, but we are looking at starting with auctions and moving into an estore and/or website to broaden our field. We have plenty of collectibles and antiques to start things and plan that we will go with popular items for BIN, some consignment and some new merchandise from various sources.
Does anyone have any particular sources of advice for us in this quest? We have read Marsh Collier's Dummy books as well as Starting a Consignment Business on eBay by Skip McGrath. All were helpful as they talked about concepts and techniques but none of them got into the specifics of dollars and cents. What kind of profits to work for and to expect, how to set up books, what realistic ratios to expect (number of auctions to completed sales, realistic commission and fee structures, realistic shipping costs, realistic times needed for setting up auctions, shipping to buyers etc.)
I feel like I am putting together a bike on Christmas eve. I have read the directions and now need the practical experienced guidance to make it come together.
Any help offered or direction suggested would be appreciated. Thanks.

Hi Trout! Welcome! I would suggest you copy and paste what you just wrote here and start a new thread. You will get a lot more responses that way. Most don't read on this thread except every once in a while. You have some great questions and I can see you are really trying to learn. Keep up the good work!

Hi guys,
I have not sold anything yet, I have two listings and was thinking of starting a store, any suggestions would be appreciated.

Oh yeah, is it e-bay legal to accept a person to person exchange of cash that is lower than the buy-it-now price or reserve price?

Hello, I am Mary from China, I just resigned my job last month and want to be a full-time eBay Seller. China is the largest fashion foudation in the world, I'm sure I can provide qualified items to sell all over the world.

This is the first time for me to do on line business, and this is the first time for me on the discussion boards also, everything is new for me, so many things need to learn, I'm not sure if I'm still so confident after half or one year, wish God could give me luck.

Hey everyone. Rick here. I have been playing with part-time Ebay selling off and on for a few years but I lost my job last week. I was a special education teacher, 50 years old, 10+ years in the system and due to school consolidation I was "no longer needed" in this parish (Louisiana). I have decided to give full time Ebay a go so I will need help from all of you if you can. I have heard that the Ebay community is a great family to be a part of and I am happy to be here. I hope I will be successful enough to stay!! I look forward to making many friends.

Great to see so many people here. Like to make friends with all of you to share experience here. I'm Chris, living in Hong Kong, a very competitive city. In middle management of a corp.

Currently looking towards selling stuff on ebay part-time, or if chances came, full-time. Any powersellers can give me a hint on what US people like from Asia? Or any hints about getting a feel of the US market is much appreciated.

Hi all! I'm Pat or Patty. I'm an errr... 40 something female in the California high desert. I'm married for 20 years to same man. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/shocked.gif" alt=":O"/> I have 1 son, 20 years old and my baby is a cat named Louis. I just started selling here a lot a couple months ago. I don't own Thea's Antiques. I work for a lovely couple who are good friends and wonderful employers. We've been trying to build up feedback by selling very inexpensive items. We went fom something like 14 to 66 in 2 months. I'm happy with my selling experience so far, as I've met a wonderful group of buyers and have been learning a lot about just what makes people happy. I think 98 % of buyers leave me positive feedback,(the other 2% don't leave any feedback) so I must be doing something right. I am really anxious to start selling more high end merchandise. My employers take very very good care of me money wise, but I am also on commission, and with the beautiful things they have to sell, I know I could make a lot of money. I just need to learn a lot. I've been reading through several blogs and forums here and can't believe how people pull together to help each other out. It's amazing and I only hope that someday I'll be in a position to help others. I wish I could devote more time to listing and to the website, but I do have some disabilities. I have nerve and disk problems and severe arthritis, so some days, I have all I can do to drag myself out of bed. I take a ton of meds that either make me sick to my stomach or sleepy. But working with Thea's Antiques has made me feel so much more useful and it helps me forget the pains. And the Heletes are such wonderful people, I want to make them a lot of money. Thea is so cute. She's always yelling at me to slow down and don't work so hard. But I find myself working not only at their house but from my own house as well. I've always been a workaholic. OK, sorry. I didn't mean to babble so much. I hope to get to know you people better and learn from you. Thanks for reading my "book" <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

Hi! I am a 70-1/2 year old great-grandmother, out of work after 40 years in the business world, and still need income. I wish employers valued my wealth of experience as much as I do, but most of them are too young to know what they don't know, so how could they? So I decided that e-bay is a perfect opportunity for me. I am new- just learning and absorbing every bit of good advice I find. I am trying to find smart and streamlined ways to do business, to maximize my time and minimize my expenditures. I have only scratched the surface and have sold a few things. I have a lot more to sell, so if anyone has suggestions- make an old lady happy and let me know!

Hi! My first post on discussion boards. I have been eBaying casually since at least 2000. Over the past couple of years I have TRIED to get a part time business started up selling on eBay. I have purchased various courses on how to do it, etc., but I am very frustrated. Here's my eBay experience in a nutshell: A GREAT place to buy stuff - you can get incredible bargains on stuff that would cost you twice as much some other place. Because of this, it is a TERRIBLE place to sell! Probably 95% of the stuff I have sold here I have lost money, and the other 5% I've maybe broken even. What am I doing wrong? I'd REALLY like to be making around an extra $500-$1000 per month working part time at this, but I have been able to make NO money selling on eBay thus far.

Hello Melinda here. Just got out of the Army after 5 years of service. Recently got remarried and now have a 16 yr old step son in addition to my 10 yr old son and 6 yr old daughter. I am selling on eBay and starting my own mail order/ online catalog (79 Ways) because I didn't want to go back to a full time job. I like being home when the kids get out of school. But right now my eBay biz is not going so well. I have not made any sales and I'm starting to get discourage. How do you do it? Make things sell. I even ship for free and offer discounts. Can some one give me some advice? Please <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/cry.gif" alt=":_|"/>

Hello - My name is Helen and I am a stay at home mother of 4. After baby 4 was born I decided to stay home due to the cost of childcare and that is when I found this wonderful place on the web called eBay. I started selling off and on in February and went for it fulltime in September. My income from selling has become more than what I made working with no childcare expenses. For anyone that doesn't think that it is possible to make a living on eBay - it is. Just make sure that you do not lay all of your eggs in one basket.

Hello,

I'm Jen, and I just recently started listing on Ebay again after a long time. I used to sell Avon Cosmetics, but I must admit, I ended up buying most of the stuff for myself, lol. Now I'm selling a variety of items; jewelery, fragrances, books etc, and I hope to make a little money this time around.

If everything works out, I will be selling full-time here! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

Hello Daniel, I have sold part time on ebay off and on for about 3 years. I have been in direct sales for 30 years and my health will not permit it much longer and my husbands job security is in real danger after 35 yrs. Obviously, I have a real need to go from occasionl to full time with ebay.
Up until now, I have basically sold things around the house trying to clutter clear and get rid of things I use to collect. I am running out of clutter that is of an value and see a real need to find reputable suppliers. I haven't been able to find an answer to a few questions on the ebay site, unless I am not looking in the right place, so hope you can help.
1) Is it necessary to have an ebay store in order to get suppliers?
2) Is it necessary to purchase an inventory first and ship myself, or are there drop shippers willing to do so at a reasonable rate?
3) I've found that calculating for a fixed rate shipping very difficult when it's impossible to tell what it will cost you to have it packed and shipped, and you don't know where the winning bid will be located. any suggestions?
4) I've also found that ebay fees and paypal fees end up taking a bite out of it, so it doesn't pay to sell many inexpensive items. your thoughts please.
thanks for any advise you can offer. Linda

Hi,

I'm Chris. 24 year old that's had a rough year. Hate to sound like I'm moaning or complaining, but in the past 3 years I've had 5 "blackout" episodes, one of which almost killed me this past May and I spent a week in ICU, then 2 more later this year. Doctor's don't know what it is, I had been employed with Caterpillar as a CNC machinist (pretty good at it and liked doing it too), but they let me go when my Short Term Disability ran up in November. I'm just wanting to learn to sell a few items here and there on eBay, not necessarily start a business.

Hi, I'm Stacey and my husband and I Robert are full time ebay sellers. We have been a member of ebay since 1998 and just in the last year decided to go full time. We sell aprox 100 items a week almost all starting at.01cent. We recently had a consignment of jewelry we had to put a reserve on but thats the only thing we have ever done that way. We swear that the.01cent idea works! We have a liquidation business for estates and businesses and also get our items from auctions and garage sales. We also do website hosting as that is my husbands other long time business (computers and networking). If anyone ever has any questions about ebay full time, photoshoping your pics for the best sell or anything else feel free to ask any time. We've had an ebay store for a month and didn't like it. Regular auctions pay our bills! I'd love to help anybody that is thinking of doing this full time. Nice to meet everyone!

Hi, I'm Janis in Alabama. I was a former power seller and left ebay to become a Katrina pet rescuer and have helped to reunite over 3,000 Katrina pets with their families. I'm still working on some cases and am also involved with a transport group that pulls pets from kill shelters and gets them to safety. I'm also trying to teach myself how to build a website for my new pet transport endeavour. I had my power seller status reinstated yesterday. I need to build a stronger and more profitable ebay business, so that I never have to return to my former day job as a paralegal, so I can have the freedom and money to pursue full time pet rescue work. Animals are my life. For the most part I have sold my own personal possessions. I've gone to auctions, yard sales, thrift stores and flea markets to find items to sell. I primarily try to focus in specific categories of arts and crafts, toys, vintage clothing and some china and crystal. I find I get my best sales from my arts and crafts listings and would love to find some reasonable wholesalers to work with, who won't require me to buy such huge quantities of inventory. I want to deal in things that are easy to ship. I dabbled a bit in jewelry sales but that is a high maintenance line. I am also interested in selling pet products with the hope of donating some of my proceeds to rescue efforts. I take a lot of pride in giving great customer service, fast shipping and little gifts along the way. I've poured through hundreds of lists of wholesalers. I've bought dropshipper lists, but don't like using them. Being computer illiterate, I am really struggling to design auction templates and usually buy them from someone else. I like the idea of this board. To my credit, I use to investigate fraud, and have successfully been responsible for shutting down many of those scams selling ebay businesses. I'm happy to share what I have learned and welcome anything anyone wants to teach me. Great Board.

Hi from sunny San Diego. I'm David. I like Ebay, chess, and investing.

Tip for new Ebayers: Always check the seller's return policy! Our policy: Return the item in 30 days, in good condition, and get a full refund. No questions asked.

Right now, I'm offering a special discount. Spend $50 at my auctions or store, and get a $5 discount. Just mention this message.

Hope to see you soon....

Hello to you all. I have just started selling on ebay. I have been buying for a few years and am giving the selling a try now.

Life is good. I'm hoping that selling on ebay will become a full-time occupation, but for now I will remain working at the local AmericInn Motel doing front desk work.

HI, I'm Angie I'm desperately working to build and ebay business. I am trying to work my off of social security disability. I am a nurse so I am a people pleaser at heart. I live in extreme rural southeast KY. There is not help that I have found for disabled women business owners like everyone thinks. I haven't found any help besides ebay help boards. I work everyday on ebay usually 10-12 hours. I only have dial up, it's the only thing available in my area. I am married and have a son in highschool. My family is proud of the work I've done. It's a big struggle for me to find products I can afford to purchase for resale. I need to earn about 3,000 a month to afford to get off of disability. That would give me enough to pay business expenses, purchase products, and pay living expenses. Not to mention I won't have medicare or a medical card for my son anymore. I make too much to get any foodstamps or anything but not enough to give up social security. Any suggestions on how to buil my business up to that level of sales? Any help would be appreciated.

Hi, I am Judy. I originally started as an ebayer back in 2004 as a buyer. I am a nurse by profession. In October 06 I went on disability, and to keep from going stark-raving mad, I started playing with ebay. my income was significantly reduced and I thought what the heck, I'll sell a few items for mad money. Then my husband lost his job 10 days after I went on disability, so we suddenly found ourselves financially insecure for the first time in a long time. He is re-employed but at a lower wage and decreased bennies. My sister does wonderful silk flower arrangements and I use to own a ceramic shop so we decided to open a store on ebay, under my ID. The store has only been up and running for a few weeks, but we haven't made one sale and I'm beginning to get alittle nervous. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/sad.gif" alt=":("/> I had surgery last Tuesday and will probably have another surgery in the next 4 weeks. I will probably return to work in late March if able, but was kind of hoping I wouldn't have to work 70 hours a week because I could supplement my income with ebay. I haven't given up, but I could sure use some advice from you experienced sellers on how to promote and drive traffic to my store? I've never been a quitter and i am not about to start now. Trying to keep Jan's (sister) hopes up too. I believe our creations are beautiful and if people would go to our store they would make purchases. Anyway, any advice would be helpful. Check out our store: J&amp;J PURRFECT SILK FLOWERS AND GIFTS. We spelled perfect wrong, but a kitty is our logo:- Thanks for having a board like this, it's a wonderful idea.

Hi,
My name is Cliff. I started selling stuff on eBay in October, 2000. Back then, it was a hobby, but now it is more than that. I retired from my job of 47 years in 2003. My wife resigned from her job in August of 2006. Now we are partners in the eBay venture. We are trying to replace the wife’s income with profits from eBay, but it’s not easy. We mostly sell clothing and we also sell other stuff that we find at Estate Sales and Auctions.
We are still trying to figure out what works and what doesn’t. Some days (rarely) sales are great but most days they stink. We’re not giving up though, because I like having my Honey home with me. She’s working a lot harder on the eBay stuff than she did at her real job, but at least she doesn’t have to drive 15 miles (in the fog sometimes) to get to work. She just has to walk from the bedroom to the in-home office. We have a store and believe it or not, about half of our sales come from the store. I'll check back here often. Maybe I’ll pick up some clues as to how to improve sales.

Have a great evening!

Hi everyone, My name is Val. I have been a life long treasure scavenger. Garage sales and any other type of sale is my favorite activity. I have always wanted to have my own business, so I started learning about how to do it on ebay in Nov.2005.
It has been a great learning experience and SO much fun!
My goal is to earn an equal or near equal imcome as my carpenter husband. When I achieve that, he wants to join me and have his own gear head store. We have very high hopes, not to get rich, of course, but to own bosses. Glad to be a part of you all.

Well I;m Rose and I work from home. I do consulting and since so many other people want to work from home that is the bulk of my clientel. I (and many others) have always suggested Ebay as a great business to start so that you can work from home. I often mention these boards as well so that other people can see that people have started their own Ebay businesses. Some people just think that it can't be done and I point to these boards as the best example of it being done! <a href="http://members.aol.com/Roseb44170/home.html">Rose</a>

Hi everyone. Looking to start a fledgling ebay store. I have already done a lot of leg work to drum up some manufacturers that I can purchase product from. Any thoughts on how to find surplus product to sell on ebay. My main product category will be everything board related, as that is what I do for a living anyway. Thanks for any thoughts.

Hello everyone, My name's Dave, I'm 49 and the father of two beautiful young adult daughters (20+22) and a recent grandfather of a five month old grandson. Like many of you, i've been involved with voulenteer activities for many years, co-founder of Macomb Habitat for Humanity. Due to declining health i've had to go on disability; i've quit doing most of my voulenteer activities and have just recently started selling on ebay. I've been gardening since i could walk.. but now that's even getting more difficult. The past few years i've been growing vegetables for fresh market sales and breeding plants in my spare time. This year i decided to try to sell my extra seeds on ebay and so far it's been a great experience.. Now if things keep up like they've been going, i may just quit growing vegetables for sale and concentrate on breeding them to develop my own variteties for seed sales next year. It's been a dream of mine for many years to start my own seed company and now with ebay as a source of customers, maybe i can get one started. I know ebay is not going to be my entire business but it's a great spring board to get me started. I would love to have something to leave behind to my daughters when i pass away, and hopefully my grandson will develop the same interest in growing plants that i have. I would love to have him take an interest in taking over the business when i'm gone... hopefully i can last long enough to make that happen. I have noticed how many different countries we have members from and i could sure use some help from anyone who knows about their local vegatables.. As a breeder i have seed samples from all around the world that i have no real knowledge about yet.. I will be trialing several hundred varieties from thailand, netherlands, russia, south america, etc, etc.. this year; and i could always use more information about them. Anyways that's my bio. I'm sure i will need tons of help from all you experienced ebayers in order to keep growing my business and i'd appreciate any help i can get. I think it's great to have these discussion boards and I look forward to meeting you all. AG Dave <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

Hi, my name is Nick Norris.

I just opened my ebay store called NOTA Industries. It has always been a dream of mine to open a skateshop, but I never had the resources to do it, until recently. I have been a skateboarder for 13 years, and I am now able to help provide products to the people that I have grown up with.

NOTA is a combination of the first 2 letters of each of my sons names. Noah and Tanner. My 2 boys are the center of my universe, and they have inspired me to take chances on my dreams.

If you know of anyone that needs some skateboard goods, send them my way <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

We now take in donations of jewelry and get women together to get them ready to sell while we discuss heart disease prevention and concerns.
We've started selling on eBay to raise some more money so we can publicize (and soon afford a website!!). Anybody's help doing this would be greatly appreciated. I'm also a full-time student, wife, flute teacher, and museum educator (I am not paid for the nonprofit work!)....so I'm pretty busy!! Thanks for any help you can offer to us!

I try to describe items the best of my knowledge but to go into more detail, I sold a gold watch to someone and give the best description that I could and of course I don't feel that it is my place to tear up someone's watch to inspect it on the inside to see if it is genuine or not...

Hi, I'm Kathy. I have sold on Ebay for about 1.5 years and finally made Power Seller last Christmas. I'm a stay at home Mom about to be an empty nester and am trying to build this business so the husband and I can retire one day and do the things we like. Those things are camping, traveling in an RV(need to buy), golfing, skiing, etc before the old bones won't let us do it anymore. I sell anything I can find a great bargain on. Mostly new items, but some used items from estate sales. It's been fun and mostly the people are great, just a couple of bad apples.

Hi my name is Hooman, I have been an eBay-holic for the last 10 months. Seriously, I'm not kidding, eBay is addictive!!!

I swear, other than food and gasoline, and maybe basic household needs, I have not bought a thing in a regular store since I found eBay! I mean, I knew about eBay years ago, but never used it until this past summer.

It's funny, any time a friend or family member wants to buy something and mentions prices I'm the first to say - you can buy it on eBay for much cheaper!

Anyway, I really want to make eBay my full-time business, doing consignment. Hopefully I can work on it a bit during Spring Break (I'm in college).

Great to be here! So far I've read a few books on eBay, and I hope to learn as much as I can.

I hope to become a Powerseller soon.

Have a wonderful day everyone!!

Hi everybody. I'm new to ebay. But I'm selling something that I know a great deal about-newsletters designed to promote discussion of current events at home with kids or with adults. I figured that I'd start selling very inexpensively so that people would take the risk. I typically sell subscriptions to the newsletter for $50 for the year, but I'm trying to raise my score and I'm already writing the newsletter so I figured that I would only charge $.99. Does this make sense or am I being way to cheap?

Thanks.

I am new to selling on Ebay as a business, but am very familiar to buying on Ebay in my personal and business life, as I am sure others can relate.

Anyway I finding out more ways to ebay, by reading and learning on ebay. So, when I came across this discussion board I wanted to say, "hi" to everyone and ask for any guidance, advice, and/or suggestions in growing viewership and sales of my auctions, from other ebay sellers, merchants and shopkeepers who may be a little more advanced on ebay.

I wish all great success on Ebay.com and hope to have the same.

Lisa

I'm Nancy and I'm 23. I've been ebaying for a little over 5 years, but just in the past year got serious about it. I graduate college with my BA in Criminal Justice in December. My plans are to continue to law school and to eventually become a lawyer, but I am now leaning more towards the crime scene investigation. We'll see what happens. I currently live in Puerto Rico and I have a long distance relationship with my boyfriend of almost two years in Orlando. I mostly sell plus size women's clothing, girls &amp; boys clothing and other odds and ends. I like the interaction with other people on here. I mostly buy dvd's off of ebay. I love dvd's. I have over 400 of them and counting. I live with my sister, my three year old niece and my one year old nephew. My mom lives right next to us. I have lived in Puerto Rico since I was 3 years old. I love talking, so if this gets too long, I'm sorry! lol. I have tons of hobbies. I live right next to the beach, so I go there at least once a week. I also love going to the movies, traveling (even on this tiny island, there are still tons of places to visit on weekends) I love to read and write (I wanted to become a writer when I was younger). I love going to the shooting range with my boyfriend when I'm in Orlando. I also like to fish and go on road trips. I love music, but I really don't have any specific favorites. I love being spontanious and taking random trips or doing random things. I also like trying new things. I am a very friendly, sweet, caring person. At the moment, I haven't got a penny to my name, but I am happy and grateful. I have learned that there are others out there who are in a worse situation then I am, so I have to be grateful. I honestly don't mind being broke. It wakes up the creative side of me. I have always loved the idea of selling my items. It started out, probably in 4th grade when I would sell my repeat stickers from the sticker book for 15 cents each! lol. I then would sell my homemade bookmarkers for 25 cents, and I would buy novelty items from Oriental Trading when I was in junior high and would make a killing! I've ran my own tutoring business for a few years now...I tutor in spanish &amp; english. I ebay. I do it all! Ok, so enough rammbling. I introduced myself....hope I didn't bore anybody! lol...Take care everybody and have a great Sunday! Nancy

Hello I am Cheryl.

I am new to Ebay. I live on the Mississipi Gulf Coast.
I have a VERY active 3 year old daughter.
I was raised in NE Texas. I was in the horse business. (raising, training, buying and selling both horses and tack) for more than 20 years. I met my daughters father who was from this area and moved to the coast 7 years ago.
Our area was hit hard by Hurricaine Katrina.
I started in Aug 06 buying on eBay when my daughter started Ballet and we could not find her dance things here. I became addicted to the auctions (I was a regular at the Horse auctions in texas and usualy bought and/or sold.
I sold my first item in Oct 2006. I desided to start selling some of the things that I had in storage in Texas. Why keep it if it was 550 miles away and I could not see it or use it (just paying storage fees). I have bought a few items for resale and am always looking for more.
I have been doing book keeping since I was 13 years old (I am 40 now). I worked for H R block for 7 years until Katrina hit. After Katrina it became better for me to stay home with my dughter until she starts school this fall. I was a manager and tax specilist for Block. I hold the Enrolled Agents certificate with the IRS.

eBy kept me sain. I was going crazy setting at home all day with a toddler to talk to. Her father is a carpenter so he works long hours and for a year he was working 7 days a week if not rebuilding a clients house he was working on ours or his mother's house.

I am new to eBay but not to selling or taxes. I will be more than happy to answer any questions about taxes or anything else that I can help with.
I hope to mke many new friends on this board!

Good Luck

Hi Everyone - My name is Connie from Colorado and I have been doing this ebay thing for a little over a month - so new I still squeak - I really did not expect to get so caught up - it is fun and addictive I have found out. Married - 39th anniversary tomorrow - 2 beautiful daughters who now live in Texas and we are both retired. I want to do something part-time on my terms and this certainly fits the bill. I have placed my 1st few items on for sale. One questions - is it usual to check your sales every few minutes (just in case I missed a bid <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/shocked.gif" alt=":O"/> ) I was excited with my 1st buy - I hope I can take it when (not if) I sell something.

Hi,

My name is Rob,I registered with ebay about 3 1/2 years ago.However,I am new to the selling game.I was recently laid off and thought I would try my hand at starting an ebay business.I have been reading and researching the ends and outs of an ebay business.What I like about the forums is that people are genuinely honest and friendly.
With all the scams out there you don't know who to trust.So,I was looking for a place where I could ask questions and get some helpful tips on launching a successful business with ebay.The last month I have sold some things around the house just to get the feel of what its like.So,I would appreciate if anyone could offer any advice on how to get products,selling strategies,etc.I am sorry about the long post,I am working on my about me page too.Please feel free to contact me at rbaseman2@yahoo.com.Visit my store too!Thanks so much for your time.

Hi Julie. What eBay category you list in depends on the item...books with books, toys with toys. When you open a store, you create your own store categories just for your own store (which are searchable so you want to use keywords). That item will show up in the eBay category within eBay, and in your store category within your store. Welcome!

Hi!

My name is Teri, aka, memphis-artists. I visited some of your sites and enjoyed them. I am new to ebay and would be interested in doing some cross promotions with other sellers. If anyone here knows how to do that and would be interested please contact me through ebay or at twcalhoun@gmail.com.

I am 53 years old. When my health became unpredictable I had to quit my job and figure out a way to support myself that I could work at on my own schedule. I have always
dreamed of doing two things: first to be a buyer for a big company and secondly to be a photographer for National Geographic. Well, now I am a buyer for my own company and
though I never attained my dream to shoot for National Geographic I realize that my skills as a photographer will
be indispensible to my business because no matter how great a product is if you can't get a good photograph of it, you can't sell it. Ebay has some very good tips on how to do that by the way, but I have found that the best
lighting is outdoors in the open shade. It was very nice meeting you all and visiting your stores.

Hi Treycee. This particular thread only gets limited exposure, so you will want to post a new question for things like that. Fixed price listings are probably the best way to bring people to your store. You can only use the email newsletters for customers who have opted in, and eBay is very strict about that. I haven't started a newsletter myself, but there are many that use one, and they are effective.

Hello everyone, im hoping this 'new member' page is still read because im wasting valuable listing making time to do this... lol... Well, my name is Jenniffer and im 23. I've had a few ebay businesses from time to time. I sold disney pins online while I was going through nursing school. I sold household stuff when I first found out about ebay. This time around I started out as "Gifts with a Porpoise" which was a site store I had here in my hometown of St. Augustine Florida. I graduated nursing school but continued to run my site store. I decided it was time for me to use the degree that I spend 20k on and years of my life so I closed the store to work for a pediatricians office and i've been selling on ebay to get rid of the store inventory and I keep re-buying some stuff and selling it. Im calling ebay my 'vacation money maker' I've got a 3 year old, who acts very much 16. Wow, I like to talk about myself don't I? We LOVE disney world. It's the basis of our free time. We're less then 2 hours away so we take the ride down all the time. It's a great way to escape real life. Im really looking forward to these boards to get some great tips on how to improve my business!

I'm just getting started in ebay, but really enjoying it. I recently recieved a large amount of roleplaying books for free from a friend. I have a large collection myself that my wife's been bugging me to get rid of for a long time. So I've been selling my stuff along with my friends stuff. It's been selling pretty well and I'd like to get into eBay as a home business in earnest but I don't really know where to start. I'm going to run out of my own stuff to sell pretty soon, and I don't have a source for more stuff to sell. So I'm starting my resarch today. So wish me luck.

Good question! I wonder that myself. I haven't got one going yet, but it is something I want to do in the future. I would think you want a mix in there. You want to discuss your products, maybe highlighting something new or promoting something on sale. You could write something informative on the subject, such as history or tips. It's also a good way to humanize yourself and set yourself apart with personal anecdotes. I would suggest finding sellers that have merchandise that is similar to yours or that you find interesting, and sign up for a couple of their newsletters. See what they do, and model yours after what you like most about theirs. Also, posting specific questions should be a new thread on the board. I seem to be the only one who comes here regularly, so you'll miss out on the opinions of everybody else. There's a whole lot of people with more information than I can give you, trust me. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif" alt=";)"/>

Hi Paula,
You're right about the posting questions. I have this board automatically e-mail me whenever there is a new post so that's why I asked here. Thanks for the tip. I will subscribe to some newsletters to get ideas. One more question - did you design your store using e-bay or did you customize it yourself. I notice some e-bayers stores are so professional looking and wonder how they did it. I promise after this question I will start posting questions on some other boards.

lol Other than my logo which I made myself, everything in my listings and store is eBay issue. I don't know enough HTML to do listing templates yet, and am considering buying a custom template for another ID I sell on, just to avoid paying the ten cent fee for the listing designer each time.

My other half and I have been doing this for about 15 years. I got starting doing the decals on the mugs and tiles because I got tired of paying good money for mugs and a couple of months later having to throw them out because the designs would chip or peel after you put them in the dishwasher My don't!!! We actually had are local cafe use them to see how the designs would hold up and they did great. Any suggestions you have for me I would really appreciate. It is very hard trying to figure out what people are looking for.

Hello,
I thought I would introduce myself. I am Rob and have been buying and selling on eBay for about 8 or 9 years now. I am now in the research mode of product sourcing trying to find my niche. I would like to become a power seller by the end of the year. I have a few ideas but so far I have not been able to find a wholesaler willing or able to provide product at a price I can resell and make a profit. I have also found distributors that will sell to brick and morter shops only. This is going to be very hard finding a company to do business with.

I hope that this thread will provide some good information to make some great decisions.

Hi Ellen. Selling for others is called a trading assistant, and there is information on that in eBay's help section, as well as a board devoted to the subject.

Hi,

I am now working part time where I learned (finally!) a little about eBay. I was hooked, and got the buying part down pat real fast. Now, I am starting to sell vintage jewelry and household items.
I leave at 5:00 am this morning for my flight to Boston for eBay Live! I thought if this was going to be my business to supplement my retirement, I needed to learn as much as possible. Just have to pack and I'll be ready.
Thanks so much for this discussion thread! I hope to meet as many people as possible who will share their knowledge about ebaying. Hopefully, I can pass along what I learn to the next group of newbies.

My darling husband works really hard everyday so we can be a home school family. We are very blessed!!

Welcome, Shannon. You're right - tons of lessons here on eBay for your son. Math, photography, English grammar, business management, ethics,...I could go on and on.

Hi, I'm Laura and I've been selling on Ebay for about 4 years now. I did the hard way - diving in and learning as I go. Now I've gotten smart and have started reading the boards! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/cool.gif" alt="B-)"/> I'm a mom of three, with only one of them still at home. I've Ebayed their way through private school, but I still have so much to learn - mainly how to say no to myself and others. My store is for vintage jewelry and BeautiControl products, but somehow I always end up with other things I'm listing for other people - which means I spend less time with "my" things. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/confused.gif" alt="?:|"/> My husband is great, works hard so I can stay home with out kids and be available for them whenever I'm needed. I'll be shipping my most recent graduate off to the Coast Guard in a couple of months - his handsome face is on my About Me page right now as I'm still flying high from actually getting him graduated!!! I enjoy Ebay and have found there to be many nice people out there.

Hello all! I am a stay at home mom, been selling a little (and buying a lot) on ebay for a few years. Finally in May (last month) I launched my ebay store, devoted to children's boutique clothing, along with a few kids' books and toys. So far I've made...a few..several..a bunch of mistakes, but I think it is going reasonably well. Looking forward to the supposed back to school rush.

Hello! I've posted on this board a few times now and I'm finding it to be one of my favorites because of the quality of the opinions and knowledge of the regulers. So, I figured I should introduce myself.

I started my online retailing business, Boldernet, LLC, in November last year, so still pretty new. I have one stand-alone website to go along with my Ebay store so far. I've been doing it full time. I've started with decorative map products, like wall maps and globes, and plan to expand that into the broader realm of "travel" products. I think I've done pretty well so far all things considered. But, I've re-invested every penny of profit so far back into inventory to grow my business. It's hard work, but a lot of fun.

Hello to all. I have been a member of ebay for some time, but just opened a store within the last couple of months. I vend at Renaissance Faires with my pewter goods and painted miniatures.

become full time (eBay) and get out of the labor intensive business. Just thought it funny that you mentioned that biz. Can anyone recommend solid reading materials out there that are NOT just hyping themselves?

I'm reading at Barnes &amp; Noble in my spare time and everyone seems to be selling something (a system, an approach, 8 cd's for $ 397 guaranteed to make you rich in 30 days). YUK. I've been in business over 18 years, and I know it takes hard work.

I'm really interested in this type of biz and would appreciate any help anyone can offer. Books, seminars, discussion boards, etc.

Brand new here, name's Adam. I work for a Fortune 500 (Top 50) company, and am just beginning selling here on ebay. I have 1 wonderful daughter who is the world to me. For her, I always strive to do my personal best in life. On here, I intend to sell domains firstly, then after most of them are sold, move onto selling iphones, hopefully within a few months or so, while the iphones are still red hot. The domains I'm currently listin are high-volume, high-profit, short name-length, most relevant you can buy anywhere. Check them out. Look forward to talking to like-minded people as I move up the ladder here on ebay. I also look forward to seeing the "powerseller" symbol next to my name within months, and pulling in 6-7-8 figure incomes, as I've read others here do. Talk to you soon!

Hi, I'm Val. I've created my store World's Home Global Market a week ago and so far no sales. I'm learning about selling and promoting. I realize I must use auctions to get things started and listed five items to auctions, no dice! But I'm still plugging away, reading, enhancing my store, adding more products (very time consuming) looking for different ways to promote. Though I did not expect the sales to come rolling in as soon as I opened the store, no sales at all is kind of discouraging. Any tips? btw, my products come exclusively from drop shippers! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/sad.gif" alt=":("/> <a href="http://stores.ebay.com/Worlds-Home-Global-Bazaar">http://stores.ebay.com/Worlds-Home-Global-Bazaar</a> <a href="http://stores.ebay.com/Worlds-Home-Global-Bazaar">

Hi Val. You have some really pretty items. Just from a quick look, I would say try adding more keywords to your titles whenever you have space - words like Asian and Oriental get searched a lot. Make your descriptions a little longer and more personalized, not just what is in the catalog. Part of your slow sales is that you are a new seller with low feedback selling some pricey items. People are more likely to take a chance on someone new when not much money is at risk. You might want to focus on the smaller stuff until you have some feedback built up. In the meantime, I would suggest reposting your question on a new thread where everyone will see it. Not many people visit this thread so you won't get a lot of input. Good luck! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

Hi everyone,

I'm Debra from upstate New York. I started selling on ebay 2-3 years ago after I started shopping. It is addicting at times. I'm always learning though as I go along. Someday's I do okay, while others nothing. I still haven't figured out why? Figured I do this until I locate a job with my 4 year degree, then I may still keep my store open. These days every little bit helps, especially having one daughter that finished college this past December, and the second will begin her second year next month, so it is always costing my husband and I which I'm sure many of you are familiar with this.
I hope to find a Coach wholesaler in my travels as I prefer to sell Coach items. I have always had that interest. Well I think it is great to introduce ourselves and, help what another when we can is what a community is all about. Have a nice evening and, I will try to schedule more time in the discussions.

Good Morning Everyone, It is nice to be back to the boards. I started selling on eBay 2 years ago. I have a passion for the opportunities that are available for energetic people. eBay is hard but rewarding work. This business is not for the lazy looking for a fast buck. I am a Education Specialist and a Trading Assistant. Recently opened a Drop Off Store in my Son's Computer Sales &amp; Service Business. The last year has not been the best for me, I had 5 hip surgeries, and my partner was diagnosed with Brain Cancer in April. Obviously I did not make it to Live this year. We did go to Live 2006 in Vegas. I am out in my studio this morning just trying to put things together and jumped on some new boards to read about folks and talk about something besides cancer and dying. My insides are in so much pain, but I am strong enough to deal with this and absorb good feelings from my wonderful eBay friends I have met over the past 2 years. Keep us in your prayers and I will come out a better person throughout all of this. Thanks for listening. Now I am going to go and read about happy things!!

Hello,

My name is El. I've lived in the west exurbs of Chicago since 1989, Texas and California before that. My ex-wife lives nearby, and we share joint custody of our last two boys whenever they aren't away at school. For different reasons, my vocational skills have become more-or-less obsolete, and I started a small brick-and-mortar store. The startup is going very slowly, and I thought I might raise a little cash by selling some unwanted personal stuff on line. That idea led to the thought of perhaps developing sales to a full-time level. I've been reading books, and I've been browsing through eBay itself, and the only real pattern I can see is that, while there are common threads, shared by almost everyone, each seller has a unique, personal approach to the problem. I don't think I need a baby-sitter (unless I'm overestimating myself), but I would be everlastingly grateful for a little advice on choosing an area of focus, and also on coordinating my presence on dBay with an independent web site.

I've read through the postings on this board, and it seems full of talented and cheerful folks. Thanks, everyone, for talking about yourselves.

Hello everyone.

Mike is the name.

I'm pretty new to selling on eBay and I really want to launch an eBay business so I can get away from the usual 9-5, work for other people idea.

I'd really like to become succesful at eBay as a means to allow me to pursue acting!

I'm back in upstate NY where I was born for the time being and enjoying the upstate summers.

I love reading these things, so many interesting and great people here.

good luck to all.

Hello, All!! My name is Tom, and I'm almost a total noob here!! I go by the moniker "Daddy_by_day" because that is what pretty much defines my existence these days! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/> My wife is a school teacher, and I am a daddy by day (thus the name) to my 3 amazing kidlets, ages 4, 2 and 6 months, and I wait tables part time at night. I'm here to try to get out of the table-waiting gig!!!! I have a buddy who does very well here, but he is an artist, and as I have NO marketable talents whatsoever, I'm reading and trying to learn. Right now I'm working my way through Skip McGrath's book, "Three Weeks to eBay Profits," cleaning out the garage for things I can list to practice and learn the ropes, build up some feedback, and of course looking for how I want to define my business and for wholesalers, drop shippers, etc. Well, that's about it for now. If anyone has any comments or advice I'd love to hear them, and if not, feel free to drop me a note and say howdy!! Blessings to you all!! Peace, Tom

Hello,
My name is Justin and we have just started selling on Ebay as far as business goes. I have been on Ebay personally for several years. We manufacture commercial christmas decorations in a brick and mortar setting. We decided to give Ebay a shot by making home decorations for every season or event. We will be offering several different lines of products in the coming weeks. Anything from Christmas, fall, wedding, baby bows, yellow bows to support the troops, spring, summer, breast cancer awareness ribbons, and a few others. Look forward to participating in the Ebay forums while I try to learn the ropes of running a business on Ebay.

Doritos? <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif" alt=":^O"/> From what I have read, changing the ID has minimal impact on your sales, but posting your question as a new thread will get it more exposure.

Hi Deb here, getting so tired of getting ripped of on ebay. Some of the sellers don't care, they won't answer your emails. I have been on ebay for 7 years and spent 100's of dollars. Lately I have been watching and a new member with 0 feedback will get on just to bid you up. If you check out their profile you find some of them joined years ago. I think it's just a way for a seller to get more money. Now not all sellers are like this some are great people and the ones who cheat give all of them a bad name.

Hi Linda. It all depends on what kind of stuff you have. I would suggest a new thread to ask your question so that it gets responses from other people. There is a wide range of sellers, so I'm sure you would get a lot of ideas. Be a little more specific as to what you are selling and what your resources are (you are in a garage, spare bedroom, that kind of thing). Good luck!

Hi Heather. I would definitely start a new thread to get more responses to your question. Also, I see there are boards that might deal more with gift baskets...Cooks Nook, and Custom Made something or other...there might be more. Read through some of their old posts or do a board search on gift baskets to see if there are specific posts on the subject that might be of help to you. Also look closely at your competitors to see what they do, and look at their completed listings to see how successful they are. A sell through rate of 20-40% is probably about average (guessing since I'm not in your category). Good luck! The baskets look lovely.

Hi Paula and all the new folks,

Haven't been on this board for awhile - good to see you are still making everyone feel welcome here Paula. When I posted here the first time I was very new and anxiously waiting for my first sale - checked my ebay items every 5 mins just in case I might have missed a bid. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/> Well, I have cut that down to every few hours now. I'm still learning as I sell part time and try various items - most of my items are from my closets, garage, etc. I tend to buy something, never use it and forget I have it. Or I buy 2 because it is cute. Well ebay has given me a place to redeem myself from myself with the shopping. I have also discovered I like going to estate auctions and my preference is pottery &amp; silver. I am having fun learning how to identify these pieces - my reaction to my study of pottery &amp; silver is "Who knew!"
Well, enough of that. Just dropped in to say hi Paula and give an update. Things are slow but it is still fun. Good luck everyone! cj

In a nutshell, they're not worth the money. On the first page of the discussion board, there is a search bar. Typing in One Source or Doba will bring up previous threads discussing these topics. Read a lot of board posts to hear from "real" eBayers before investing money in anything. The books can be very misleading sometimes.

But need people to start looking to be able to do that. So like I said any suggestions you can give this 21 year old disabled gal would be a huge help, thanks. GOD bless

Hello, all! My name is Steven. I have been selling on ebay for about a year now, but I opened my first account as a buyer about 5 years ago.

I have read tons of posts and information looking for tips for selling on ebay and have finally found a niche (I think...er, hope)

I am 24 years old from KY and am looking to make ebay my full time job in the near future. I am currently working as a delivery driver for a local pharmacy. I get to deliver to nursing home and meet all kinds of wonderful people. I get great satisfaction from my job but the hours are extremely long and are all midnights. It makes me feel like a vampire in the winter! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif" alt="]:)"/>

I just opened a group on ebay for anybody wanting to discuss alternative ideas for selling on ebay. There are tons of great posters out there that have helped many of us, but I think that some people might have some "out of the box" ideas they would like to share with the rest of us! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

I am always searching for better ways to do things so any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

I wish you all the best of luck in becoming successful ebay sellers!

Hi,

I've been on Ebay since 1999. I started a promotional products business earlier this year and have been toying with the idea of doing something on here to get new business. I just created my store today and will start creating items and putting them up ASAP. Part of my problem is figuring out what to put up here. I have access to hundreds of manufacturers that make hundreds of thousands of promotional items (yes, there are that many).

My store is called Southwest Logo and I'm working full time on making this work.

Hi, My name is Valerie. I am 46 years old and today is my 16th wedding anniversary. I have 3 great kids - a 24 year old step daughter, a 12 year old daughter and a son who just turned 10 on Wednesday, a dog, a cat and a bearded dragon. I started out on ebay as a very part time seller 3 years ago and opened up an ebay store almost 2 years ago. I am ready to be more serious about my ebay selling and take it to the next level. There is a lot I have already learned but lots more I need to learn. I would like to belong to a group where we share ideas and help each other grow our businesses. The name of my store is Junkhound Sally Antiques. I sell antiques, vintage items, collectables and who knows what. I will sell whatever I think will bring me a profit. I shop garage sales, estate sales, flea markets and thrift stores, but mostly garage sales and estate sales. I also sell items for others on commission, mostly by word of mouth. I look forward to learning and helping others too!

Hello Group
Although I have been a part of the eBay community since 2001 I have sold some and mostly bought on eBay. I am about to wade back into the water and try my hand again. I had a water business a couple years back, but the manufacture put a nix on me using eBay to market and sell from. Which basically killed my business. So now I really am starting again. I forgot all the technical stuff and what is best way to post (Auctivia or another program?) Pictures etc. I know over time eBay is not cheap to post to and it gets hard to make a profit unless you have items that are hot and cost you almost nothing to obtain. Please any of you care to put me up some road signs as I need to get these items up and listed soon. By the way this group site is a whole lot easier to post and navigate than some of the other forums. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

Hello I am the wife of Futbolred. I am so new to all this that I am writing my intro in the reply section. I guess why I am here is to shed some light on my less then perfect rating of 76%. When I eirst used ebay I was totally clueless about computers never mind ebay. So the lingo was unfamiliar. I didn't even know what a fat quater was. So when I was skimming through and saw the caption 100+ fat quaters.99ea. I assumed it was a 100 squares of fabric with the starting bid of.99. I have seen many to good to be true offers so I thought this was one of them. I won. what I received was 1 peice of cotton fabric. I was in the middle of chemo at the time and probably not on my best behavior so my feedback to this guy was umm not so nice. He cursed at me in his response which my husband reviewed before me and said some very mean things.This started a huge brawl. I felt he misrepresented his product. It truely read like you were going to get 100+ squares. The icing on the cake was when his wife told me in a response that people like me shouldn't survive cancer, it got really ugly. Then there was Bargain land. Don't shop there you get 1/2 of what you win and the 1/2 you get is not what you bargained for. anyway the chemo got the best of me and I was bedridden for a spell and didn't care much about anything. So my score is rlated to purchases not sales. I do have very positive feedback from the people who delivered what they advertised. With this in mind I plan on being a seller who is honest and willing to make my customer happy at all costs. Well thats my story about kmy feedback score. Thanks for listening, Deborah

<post author="chrisnersales" datetime="2007-11-16T15:05:00" id="p574">
Hi, Deborah. Welcome to eBay. I will say that was rough. I would have thought the same thing. And even one negative with that low of feedback is going to lower the percentage. Work on getting good feedback and that percentage will climb back up. If you want advise from some experienced sellers or just a place to chat, you have come to the right place. If you are up at night, you can join us in the Night Owl's Nest, another board here on eBay... Linda

Hello Bryant: I just wanted to welcome you and say that going to college is very important. I am a mother of two tween girls and I am currently finishing up my business degree as a full time student. You can do ebay full time and work and go to college. Ebay is not as difficult as trying to do it all and have children and a family too. I know I have done it. Go to college and do ebay part or full time too. Take three classes instead of four of five. Good Luck with your adventures. Diana

Bryant, Please consider going to college and working at UPS while you earn a degree. You could get a business degree with a focus in entrepreneurship which will help develop your business skills. An income from UPS could fund the startup costs of a new business on eBay. College is a great experience! Since you are young, you may be able to work at UPS, start an eBay business and go to school all at the same time...just like Diana suggested in her post. My son is also interested in starting an online business. He has seen through my efforts (with a brick and mortar store and my eBay store) that it takes a very long time to build a business to the point of making a profit. It may take 6-24 months for you to start turning a profit and in the meantime you still need money to live on. Your local Small Business Administration and SCORE groups(Senior Core of Retired Executives) offer free training and consulting for entrpreneurs and small business start ups. I would suggest meeting with these folks to begin developing your business plan. They are usually quite nice and most helpful. Good luck!

Hi Everyone,

My name is Jameel, I'm 28 years old and mother to a 5-year old boy. I recently relocated to Georgia and I'm having a heck of time finding a job in my field.

When I'm not working full-time, I own and manufacture soy candles. I have been in the candle making industry for 10 years. I have a passion for what I do and I enjoy providing products to my customers that are eco-friendly and safe. My business name is: Kandle Indulgence Company.

I have primarily sold products via my web site and I had an eBay account before but someone installed a key tagger on my computer and was able to log into all of my accounts and one of those being my eBay account. They were submitting illegal auctions. So after have built my reputation on eBay I now have to start all over again. It sucks but I have to do what I have to do.

I look forward to meeting new entrepreneurs on here.

All the Best,

Jameel

I am really struggling, what do I sell on eBay? I thought I would like to sell computer memory so I started looking for wholesalers. I found no one who could sell to me low enough to make a profit on eBay. I can buy for what it sells for on eBay. My wife wants to sell clothing and purses, tons of people already selling these items, lots of auctions don't sell. What should I do. I would like to find a product that is not the mainstream but has a demand, even if its small. A niche! But what? And Where? How do you guys buy low enough to sell on eBay for a profit?

<post author="lannaart" datetime="2007-12-02T15:14:00" id="p588">
The people who are selling an item on ebay and making a decent profit are getting that item direct from the manufacturer. Wholesalers in the US for example buy it from the importer/distributor and put a nice profit on top. The distributor buys it in bulk from the factory direct and ships it in from China for example - in most cases after the importer has visited the factory in China. You can buy direct from China by searching Alibaba for suppliers but the price you get depends on the quantity you are buying. There are some reliable manufacturers you can contact directly like Siam Intercontinental Handicrafts but be careful to make payment thru Paypal with a credit card to be on the safe side. There are too many stories out there of people getting delivery of shipments that have no resemblance to what they ordered. At least using a credit card thru Paypal you are covered for that sort of thing. Good Luck !

Howdy from Northern California! I've been dabbling in eBay since August, 2004, and have used it as a great resource for buying and selling collectibles, software, mystery auctions, and other items. Earlier this year a business acquaintance told me about how he had turned his eBay hobby into a full time business. I was impressed and decided to look into it further. About four months ago, I picked up a copy of Griff's eBay Bible at a local bookstore. I've read it cover to cover and now I'm proud to say that I have applied what I have learned and built my own eBay business. I've created an LLC and have three very reputable suppliers. Oh, and don't let me forget to mention that I joined World Wide Brands, which has been a fantastic tool from day one. Although my store has a ways to go, I seem to be doing all right so far - at least by my expectations. Feel free to check out my store and let me know what you think. Perhaps if you have any constructive criticism, I would like to hear it. You can click on my profile to get to my eBay store. Thanks for reading this and Happy Holidays!

Hello everyone <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/> I've been selling on eBay for approximately 10 years now (many years ago with a different ID), and I love selling here, just wish sales would pick up soon. I live in southern Indiana, my home, but I have lived in Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona, doing eBay in each location while I lived there. I just turned 60 years young and I also work from home doing medical transcription (13 years now), but would Much rather just sell on eBay full time. So far it hasn't been stable enough for me to do that, as I'm single and responsible for my total income. I'm still working on this, though, and don't plan to give up my dream of being an eBay Powerseller and doing it full time!

I have a question for you all....has anyone here upgraded from a basic store to a premium store? I just did a couple of days ago to see if the "more exposure" on eBay and the other selling tools it includes such as market research, will make it worth the extra cost. If anyone else has done this, I'd love to hear your experiences, good or bad. I'm not sure I'll keep this level, but thought I'd try it for a month and if it doesn't show that I'm getting more attention and sales then I'll go back to the basic store.

Thanks!

Hello, Daniel here an Ebay addict for the last five years or so. Father of two most excellent offspring, Youth Softball Coach, and 20 yr. husband to the boss of the house. I have always enjoyed helping others, especially the disadvanted youth of our country. I am proud to be a C.A.S.A. volunteer and former Big Brother. It is satisfying to help other Ebayers avoid the costly time consuming mistakes we made when we started. It's a big business preying on new Ebayers and hopefully we saved a few from the most prevalant dropshipping/ebook/wholesale list scams out there.

Hello everyone,

I am Tricia Walsh (balletpainter). I am an artist and love painting portraits and dance. My daughter is 11 and passionate about ballet. I spend a lot of time at her ballet studio. This gives me lots of material for painting.
I am new to ebay, and have recently begun selling miniature (ACEO size) paintings on a dance theme. It's just a beginning but I am thrilled about having sold 4 paintings, so far. I would appreciate some pointers as to how to give my paintings more exposure. (I'm not yet ready for a 'store') I know there are many ballet and dance lovers out there who would like them, but how to find them, or let’s say have them find me.
I don’t see any ballet or dance related discussion boards. Anyway would appreciate suggestions. Thanks!

Hi Tricia and welcome.

Cool pillows! I think the most important part of getting traffic to your listings is the keywords you use in your item title. Use every character you can. Have the word handkerchief in addition to hankies, throw in colors, just fill that line to the best of your ability. There are tons of ways to increase traffic to your listings. Reading through old posts on the boards is a great way to discover some. Good luck to you!

Hi I'm Sandy

It's been six years since I've sold on ebay and I have to say I'm a little overwhelmed with new changes.

I moved from the northeast to Florida and had no time to pursue ebay and my computer got to slow that's why the long absence.

I'm off to slow start getting back into the grove and could use a little encouragement. Yesterday I got myself into trouble in one of the discussions groups and got so lost trying to retract I still have no idea where I was or how to unpublish.

I'm making a fresh start today and hope for the best that I'm not violating any ebay rules.

Thanks for listening.

After a frustrating start, yesterday the bulb in my head started to brighten. I had A break-thru I was successful and even understood what I was doing.

Today I even was able to view my posting to this chattroom from yesterday.

The best part was when I went to take a workshop yesterday for this new computer and met other overwhelmed people. You know what they say "misery loves company" I just mean their are other people out their struggling to keep up with the new technology.

I am married with 3 kids. Moved back to the UK after 7 years working in Thailand as an accountant.

I am a real fan of the USA and frankly get bored with Europeans bashing the USA and her people - I don't consider myself European, I am British and I have a lot more in common with Americans than Europeans.

My final value fees will now change depending on where my customers lives. Wow is that legal! if you ship heavy items like speakers this is a big big change. As International shipping costs are a lot more than domestic shipping costs, my Ebay fees will be higher on my International sales.

They were probably thinking the same thing as Amazon. If you charge a FVF for shipping then you no longer reward people who sell and item for.99 with $200 shipping. In the big picture I think this will result in a healthier marketplace.

From what I've learned about FVF fees on international shipping, You only pay the % on your lowest offered Domestic rate, regardless of the actual international rate. Example: You offer FREE shipping to USA and buyer in AU buys your item. Since you offer free shipping you are not charged any FVF on shipping no matter what it costs to ship. You only pay the FVF on the item itself. If your first Domestic shipping choice was $5.oo, then you pay FVF on the $5.oo S&amp;H + FVF on item
Understanding, "One is just the middleman for the collection &amp; forwarding of all fees &amp; postage", is the first step to avoid paying them out of pocket.

I have been thinking the same thing as Faerie, but I have to agree it's going to hurt on international sales. I do a lot of international business (maybe 30-40% of my non perishable items) and only see this hurting me badly. I also charge by weight, plus a $1.00 or $2.00 handling if it's something that requires a lot of materials and time to pack. If they only make the fees happen to US sales then I wouldn't care to much, but shipping a 3 to 5 pound boxes to Australia (which I ship there quite often) will no longer be that exciting. I'm glad I have been expanding elsewhere on the internet and will continue to due so at a much quicker rate after receiving the e-mail this morning.

I sold a $4.95 HO scale box car to a guy in Australia. I'm shipping 1st class so from the USPS website Priority shipping is like $27-$28. I usually go with what the USPS says so I am usually losing money already on boxes and packing materials. So I have insertion fees, final value fees on the total sale plus the shipping and Paypal fees when I get paid which already includes 2.9% on the shipping. So I make less than $1 on my item. I am going to start having my customers wait for an invoice and tell them in my listings that due to Ebay's greed there will be an extra fee added to the invoice so it's not part of the final value fee. I will call it the Final Value Fee on Shipping. The fee will always change based on the shipping cost. Sorry customers but Ebay is not just gonna screw us sellers, we will pass the extra costs on to you.

Just say in your listing that you are going to charge the extra for handling but have the customer wait until you send him an invoice and put the charge on there, do not add it to your auction total.

This new policy will definitely kill international sales and here is a perfect example why:

Let’s say I sell am selling pair of shoes for $50.00. I normally charge $10.00 U.S. shipping (depending on where it is going sometimes I have to kick in a little) and $33.00 for shipping to Europe.

With the rate increase I now have to add an additional $1.10 to cover the new fees.

In order to offer FREE shipping I now have to list the shoes at $61.10 just to keep everything the same.

The guy in Europe who could have bought my shoes for $83.00 now has to pay $94.10.

I bet he goes to a different site to buy his shoes and other items.

You would be charge a fee on your FIRST Domestic rate in your listing. To offset the $10.00 to ship, add.11cent per $1.00 or 1.11 into your start price. any S&amp;H over the 10.oo to UK would NOT be charged an eBay fee.

The way I came up with adding.11 cent per $1.oo to starting price. I went to their calculator and used 1.oo for the rate. Then I took the % and figuredd in the eBay FVF and found that...... Adding.11 cent per $1.oo S&amp;H charged into the item Starting price you even out. This is based solely on their calculator, If you sell media you should add.15cent per $1.oo S&amp;H charged, if you don't have a store. And tech FVF drop to 7%. On one of these posts I posted the actual cent per $1.00 to add to your listing per catagory.

From what I've learned about FVF fees on international shipping, You only pay the % on your lowest offered Domestic rate, regardless of the actual international rate.

Example:

You offer FREE shipping to USA and buyer in AU buys your item. Since you offer free shipping you are not charged any FVF on shipping no matter what it costs to ship. You only pay the FVF on the item itself.

If your first Domestic shipping choice was $5.oo, then you pay FVF on the $5.oo S&amp;H + FVF on item <img src="images/quote-right.gif"/>

Sorry that doesn't answer the question, I use calculated shipping, so how are they going to figure the lowest domestic shipping and to which state California or New Jersey.

My final value fees will now change depending on where my customers lives. Wow is that legal! if you ship heavy items like speakers this is a big big change. As International shipping costs are a lot more than domestic shipping costs, my Ebay fees will be higher on my International sales. This new policy will definitely will reduce the amount of auctions I open up to International customers. What was Ebay thinking?

I have read and read and am not just spewing. I am trying to think proactively. I cannot offer flat rate on my items.. like hifi I only use calculated shipping. Unlike Hifi my average weight is only 4lbs so the impact I feel will not be as great as theirs. I cannot add.11 per $1.00 because I do not have a crystal ball to know who will buy my items so therefor do not know where it is shipping. I am thinking that it will be the law of averages for shipping weights/costs and on some I will lose and on some I will hopefully win enough to cover those loses but in the end its the buyer who is going to feel it the most because I will be passing my costs along.

Do the.11cent per $1.oo as IF it were going to zone 8. You don't need a crytal ball, just a little math.

I have a Rinnai in the box. This water heater weighs 65lbs. I have it isted as FREE shipping so I won't be charged FVF on S&amp;H. BUT, if i did have a shipping charge (starting price would be lower) I would simply add.11 cent per $1.00 shpping. Example...... Rinnai weight 65lbs UPS shipping 97.63.11cent X 98 = 10.78 So I would ADD 10.78 to my starting price and be done with it.

They will base your S&amp;H FVF on your FIRST Domestic choice in your listing as if it were going to zone 1 (which is the cheapest for you) anything over that for the item selling to International buyer has NO S&amp;H FVF.

Faerie " come to the bords and spew" are you ffin kidding me? how about your 12k+ posts of spew. defending Ebay and spewing. Are you on the Ebay payroll. I can do my own math, I know this increase hurts alot for me. Now I will see if it still is worth my time. I've never defended eBay. In fact, I've talked more people out of selling on eBay than I've ever encouraged to sell here. I know what eBay is and what it isn't. eBay is a single digit percentage of my retail business and I am making no attempt to increase the share. One thing that is worth considering is changing your perspective on shipping. For many it is worthwhile to look at shipping from an overall perspective rather than a per item perspective. Everyone has to do their own cost/benefit analysis. How it affects you as a seller will also change as your category settles out. Remember, this will affect your competitors as well. BTW - I find if you doubt my legitimacy as a business, you can go on Bing or Google maps and find my facilities. I like to look from time to time to see where my van was when they took the picture. Once on Bing it was both between my buildings and at my house. I had no idea my van was capable of time travel.

Just charge a handleing fee to cover the extra FVF-pass it on to the buyer-thats how the real world works.
It sucks but Que Cera. Management does not care-they wanted more money and thats it. It is not going to change-I have as yet seen them go back on an increase. Until they price themselves out of the market it will not happen. Just keep looking and trying for other methods to sell away from Ebay. My sales on Craigs list have been increasing and are more profitable than Ebay. The last big increase several years ago made me realize that I had to go elswhere. I sell just as much. Ebay just does not make a percentage on those other sales. Ebays loss.

It sure would be nice if someone else went into serious competition with Ebay.

IT is all about extracting money for profit and shareholder equity.....

"eBay Going After Sellers - Analyst Blog
8:40p ET March 16, 2011 (Zacks.com)
eBay Inc. (EBAY) announced a couple of initiatives for buyers in an attempt to improve the traffic to its online marketplace. Sellers will now be able to list up to 50 items for free. They will also be eligible for lower charges when they allow free shipping to customers.

In the past, eBay faced a lot of criticism from sellers for announcing a seller rating system that effectively enabled buyers to identify those sellers that offered them a better experience, including free shipping.

While many small sellers complained, since they were unable to provide the advantages demanded in a competitive market, the system enabled eBay to incentivize the sellers that were bringing more buyers and therefore, more sales to the company. These sellers received a special badge that helped attract buyers. They also received other benefits, including discounts.

Another significant change in recent times is eBay’s focus on the fixed price format, which is the standard system of purchasing things online. During the analyst day held last month, eBay announced that fixed price sales may be expected to grow, while sales under the auction format would probably stay at current levels.

While a smaller entity, the company relied more on the auction format that attracted all kinds of sellers and buyers. But the growing ecommerce market demanded a rebuilding of the company’s image and the value of its brand, a failure to execute on which would be detrimental to the company’s growth.

For this purpose, eBay also increased much-needed investment in technology with the intention of improving its search engine and enabling easier navigation. The newly-introduced carting system (already available at many online retailers) is a positive and should facilitate the purchasing of multiple items on each visit to the marketplace.

At its analyst day, eBay stated that the marketplaces business would grow at a CAGR of 7-10% to $7-8 billion in 2013, while Forrester expects low double-digit growth for the industry over the next few years.

The reason for the lower growth rate at eBay is the flattish performance expected of the auction business, which would offset the increase under the fixed price format, as well as in other areas, including classifieds, advertising and Stubhub. eBay said that its efforts at search enhancements, catalog capability and improvements to buyer trust and protection were already paying dividends.

Estimates have been relatively stable since the company had its analyst day, although they are up significantly since the fourth quarter earnings announcement. We believe in management’s growth strategies and think that efficient execution will enable the company to win back market share that it previously lost to other players, such as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN).

We have a short-term Hold rating on eBay shares, as indicated by the Zacks #3 Rank."

And they never stop finding ways, believe me. Strap in. This aint' the end. What I find interesting..... Ebay introduces a discount based on performance. THEN ebay introduces a flawed performance evaluation service. THEN ebay makes it harder to get a discount. THEN ebay makes it so buyers will have more and more reasons to ding your performance in order to remove the chance of you reaching the discount levels unless you sell at high volumes and can bury complaints easily. Yes....I wonder whats next.

Here a great way to have the lowest prices on ebay for same items, beat the multiple listing rule and promote ebay local. (which ebay has abandoned since it does promote HIGH volume sellers they rather have instead of us). Open a B&amp;M (might be worth it now), list a bunch of your items lower than everyone else with NO SHIPPING and require pick up only for those items. If you have an ebay store you can make a category for "local pick up only". Saves shipping, shows better ranking for lowest price + shipping in Item search &amp; best match. AND saves you paypal fees for CASH ON PICK-UPS! Hmmmmmm

I understand if they need raise fees, prices and costs are up everywhere. Attaching it to the shipping is not the way to go however. If they're so worried about unreasonable shipping quotes (and I see a lot of them), they should find some way to police them (like force use of the shipping calculator with ads). There are several problems with this being attached to the shipping: I sell a lot of books. Books tend to be heavy, plus many don't sell for tons of money. I normally offer my customers (depending on the weight) their choice of media mail, first class, or priority, sometimes overnight. When they choose the faster and thus more expensive shipping, i get to pay extra for that. This goes moreso for overseas sales. There is no bulk rate for books anymore, only first class and priority. Both are EXPENSIVE. Again I get to pay extra for selling overseas. Their solution will probably be that I should offer free shipping. Nice idea, but I have to pay for my items to get quality items customers like to buy. I try not to buy junk. They've still got time to tweak this so as not to drive people off the site. I think if they had just come out and said there would be a regular final value fee increase that there would be the usual grumbling by everyone, but most would go on with their business. This could hurt and I'm not overly impressed by the (apparant) lack of thinking behind this.

My items are built to order so, I can't list with "one dayz" shipping. Most of my cliental are very familiar with a wait time for this particular type of product so, my DSR hasn't been dinged yet even after hundreds of transactions. So, I'll be losing about $50.00 a month by not getting the FVF discount. Oh well, time to raise my prices a bit to compensate.

I guess my listings won't be high on the search list either but, fortunately, this is not an overly saturated category. And not really too many other TRS's.

3/8 ths of my items i imprint to order so goodby TRS.

I ship in 4 to 10 days depending if I have the item in stock or I have to order it.

I am not upset over it, IT IS WHAT IT IS. My local sales are increasing so hopefully Ebay will become an after thought.

I am going to set the listing all up with the return of 30 days and 1 day shipping on all other items. Perhaps ( if it is a percentage of items that have to ship in one day and be posted) I could keep my TRS since i only sell the 3/8ths item as a small percentage of my total sales)....hope this makes sense.

Clay:

I could be wrong but the way I read it is that you can keep your TRS status but, just won't get the 20% FVF discount or high search rankings on items not listed with one day shipping. The only thing is you'll still have the "TRS" logo in your listings.

I'm also building a business outside of ebay so, hopefully soon, ebay will be a side project. So far this year 1/3 of my sales were non ebay. Up from 1/5 in 12/11.

It'll all work out.

Franz: Sounds more like you have a perspective problem if you consider eBay your business "partner". eBay is no more a partner than your landlord, supplier, or the local tax collector. This is a perspective I see daily with newbie seller... not so much from the more experienced seller, and almost never with multi-venued sellers.

eBay is not your partner. I repeat myself for those who have reading or comprehension issues.

eBay is a venue - one place among many where merchants can expose their wares to potential buyers. And while they may be the biggest gorilla on the block, they are not they only, and for some they are not even the primary.

When the 'greed' exceeds, leave. When selling on any given venue is no longer profitable, or no longer suits your plans - leave. You are unlikely to remake the venue to suit your needs, so rather than irritate yourself by staying on a venue that no longer fits, find one that does.

The most successful sellers did this years ago - that's why there are so many alternate venues today. Take full advantage... you may be surprised. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

Another account. Now I can't sell anymore.

I'm really taking huge steps in improving my descriptions, my shipping time, the entire quality of my auctions and selling status. But now things have taken a turn for the worst.

My ebay was going fine. had 9 listings on 1 accounts and 9 listing on another. Just shipped out a free item to a happy buyer and now and thigns were going smoothly but I'm screwed.

I opened a new account because I needed to pay my rent and food due to not being able to get enough hourse to do so.. Now I am in the process of losing my apartment and am having a hard time spending money on food.

I really need some help from someone. Thanks

Unfortunately, eBay is no longer the place to make money fast and/or easy. In fact, it can take months to gain enough traction (sales history) to even begin to consider generating a sustainable income.

The user agreement, the long one that on one ever reads, gives eBay the right to link your accounts, thereby enforcing suspentions on any/all of your accounts due to infractions on any account. It's there to prevent scammers from creating dozens of bogus accounts to scam people with. Of course, the 'smart' scammers caught on long ago and use bogus names/addresses (did you know you can specify any apartment number and the mail will still be delivered to your stand-along home?).... so, much like gun laws, the eBay rules really only impact honest folks.

I'm sorry to hear about your situation -- I actually had to close my eBay business when the recession hit and return to a "real job". Didn't pay much, but it kept the lights on.

I do not know if you are suspended forever.

The world is much bigger than ebay. You can make money locally. you can sell on other venues (for sure you may not make as much at first as you could on Ebay). There are other possibilities.

You learned some valuable lessons about customer service that could serve you well in the future.

So go, love, live, and when you make it big they will tell the story of how you were suspended from once, and people will shake their heads at the amusing story.

After selling on eBay for six years, our selling account was suspended. We had some problems over a year ago and just never recovered enough.

Without eBay our January sales were up 65%. eBay is only one way to sell online. If I hadn't told them, my employees wouldn't even know we weren't selling on eBay anymore.

I'm not saying this casually., It's much more compertitve outside of eBay - but there are also a lot more buyers and a lot more ways to reach them.

Chan has answered your question. You can list 100 items period. You can have 1 listing with 100 items, 100 listings each with 1 item or any combo but the end result is 100 items listed.

Here's Chan's original response in Chinese:

的數量上的限制是基於不只是對上市的數量，但出售的數項........減少每個上市出售項目1或2，將允許您列出額外

Hope this helps.

limitation are not just on number of item listed,most of the time they also included dollar value.

when that value is reach on total number of item offer for sale.it override the number of listing.and block further listing.

Chan--its also on a rolling month right?

So for example, limit of 10...you make 1 listing with 10 items but then decide to reduce it to 5 and add another listing with 5, they will not let you do that until the 30 days are up because technically you had already reached your limit.

The same way non-store peeps get 50 free auction listings every 30 days.

Paypal 21 day Hold on TRS with 100% Feedback. Why?
</headline>
<post author="passionsdirect99" datetime="2011-10-05T17:57:00" id="p1">
Hello everyone:

I'm a top rated seller with 100% positive feedback. For some reason Paypal puts a 21 day hold on my funds. They took it off for about a month and now its back on again.

I haven't had any complaints-just a slew of non-paying buyers (I really get sick of it), anyway I was wondering if anyone else is having this issue?

Any advice?

Thanks,
Nessa

If I had to hazard a guess, I'd guess it has something to do with the product line you carry. If claims and charge-backs are up for this type of product line across eBay, then good sellers can get caught up in the Hold with the marginal sellers.

Use delivery confirmation on every shipment, and check to ensure your funds are being released no later than 24hrs after the USPS posts the package as received. You should be able to cut the 21 day hold down to a more manageable 4-7 days. After a few weeks of consistant early release, petition eBay/PayPal for the blanket hold to be removed, based on your current activity and that of the past 12 months. Show them that you are one of the good guys... one of the sellers they want to promote, not restrict.

And look into the alternate sales sites... there's more than ever before, and they are getter better results as well. Could it hurt to expand into other venues... with lower fees and fewer rules?

More than likely it's due to a couple of things, for one, no returns are allowed and the pictures of your items are not your pictures and looks to be pictures of out of the catalog. So between those two, Ebay is wanting to probably ensure your buyers are protected and are receiving the actual item. You may want to change your refund policy and when you do, you can add your terms of service in the refund, for example, buyer pays the return shipping costs, and document any restocking fees if normal.

And it's possible that your store may appear to be a "drop ship" type of business, unless you actually carry every single item and have each one in stock.

My guess though, it's the "no returns' and the catalog pictures that may be causing this to happen to you.

Hi,

I am barely past the 90 day mark, but I had the original restriction removed only to have a new 21-day restriction placed back on my account a few weeks ago. I promptly contacted paypal and they advised that it was due to the increased activity on my account. They reviewed my account and called me back within the hour and removed the restriction. Try giving them a call.
thank you

I really believe it the number of listing, type of item listed price of item, activity on your account

you account have slow activity and all the sudden the listing number jump. You now have around $60000 if not more in your listing but not much prior sale, ebay want to know if you really have those item in stock, I won't e surprise if they ask you to show invoice soon

I must say I'm shocked &amp; dismayed to hear that even top rated sellers are experiencing this hold!

I'm a newbie, only been out here since April, but I've got 100% positive feedback too &amp; zero complaints because I treat my customers right; everything is always very carefully packed, &amp; often shipped the very same day that payment is made, always with a tracking number, lots of communication &amp; a no questions asked return policy. It's critically important to me to maintain a base of totally satisfied customers, &amp; for whatever reason the muckety-mucks at eBay &amp; PayPal just don't want to acknowledge that.

I have called PayPal, several times now, &amp; they have been completely unwilling to remove this blanket hold on my account. Now that I've decided to stop using PayPal altogether I've found it's almost impossible to do that... eBay has numerous road-blocks setup to make sure that one way or another, you're GOING to use PayPal whether you like it or not.

The lastest in my situation is that after plugging in my merchant account into eBay &amp; having it tested (i.e., they did a $1 authorization against my account to make sure everything was working), I am now getting a message every time I try creating a new listing that says "... you need to fax over a copy of your merchant statement so we can make sure you have a valid merchant account". RIDICULOUS, since they already know this to be the case. And I'm positive that once they review this fax, they'll just come up with some other lame excuse as to why I can use it instead of PayPal.

It's a real shame, but I have reached the point where my main mission in life is to get myself off of eBay completely. It's a shame because I really like the site; it's fairly robust, feature-rich &amp; complete, &amp; the only problem I've had out here is with eBay/PayPal's endless array of red tape... never a problem with my customers (except for the non-paying bidder here &amp; there, which thankfully have been few in my case).

Anyway, I understand that I'm just a fraction of a drop in the big eBay bucket, &amp; I suppose that's the main problem I'm faced with in getting this resolved. I wish you luck, &amp; who knows... maybe I'll see you somewhere on the other side of this mess.

Thanks for the replies. I found an interesting post on the Paypal discussion board. This may in fact be the actual reason Ebay/Paypal are holding funds, even for sellers with thousands of feedback and years selling here.

Turns out there were 2 top rated sellers who scammed buyers out of $800, 000 before getting caught and arrested. I think the second TRS actually scammed about 1 Million dollars out of buyers. One of them was selling stolen merchandise. I remember seeing something about this on the news sometime back as well.

There are lots of fraudsters and scammers every where and I imagine many are still hocking stolen merchandise on Ebay, however, the honest dealer is having to pay the price by having their funds held.

It sucks and Ebay needs to find a way to deal with the true scum- I mean-scam artists and let us good sellers alone to run our businesses.

I finally contacted PayPal to inquire about the 21-day hold that has been placed on my other selling ID.

Basically, they implemented a new "policy" that downgraded me to a "standard" seller, on account of slow sales activity on that account.

Of interest, PayPal actually CALLED me, to reply to my email messages. After getting funds released on a current hold, which showed delivered, but not updated, I was then transferred to a rep at eBay, who basically told me I would have to live with the payment hold, regardless of my selling history on my main account, which would be automatically lifted once I had reached that 100 annual transaction threshold, and maintained good buyer ratings.

I am OUTRAGED by the holds placed by Ebay.....Im a small seller.....been a member for a long time. (not very actice). Not only is EBAY holding my funds, even after a positive feedback has been left.....then there is PAYPAL, now they are holding funds until a delivery confirmation is recieved. Well.....there are 2 items that are for PICKUP only. So now what hold my funds for 21 day???

I DONT THINK SO.

With the millions of EBAY customers.....and the millions of funds on hold for 21 days.....just imagine the revenue for the interest alone. Fees for this, and fees for that.......then still making more money on our holds???? Don't let them fool you, its not for customer satisfaction.....its not for fair practice....its for them ALL FOR THEM.....ALL FOR THEIR WALLETS.

I DONT THINK SO.

I would cancel my account right now.....BUT MY FUNDS ARE ON HOLD. Then what....I wont get my money???? or some other lame excuse.

I DONT THINK SO.

There are many other options to sell good quality items.....for a fair price and not get treated like this way. Its too bad, Ebay WAS a reputable company.

Will I stay here...... I DONT THINK SO.

"Well.....there are 2 items that are for PICKUP only. So now what hold my funds for 21 day???"

When the customer agrees to pick up, it is best to use a form of payment not normally allowed -- CASH. The customer has the opportunity to inspect the item before accepting delivery - so there should be no reason for a refurnd/return. And eBay does allow CASH for local pickup orders.

Funny stuff, that cash. Seems you can spend it almost anywhere... it's almost as convenient as a charge card. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

After 8 years of being an Ebayer, I am put into the beginners list once again. Come on, 8 years of HONEST transactions same bank account and no negitive? Well whats good for the Goose should be good for the Gander, (Ebay/Paypal) Leave the funds alone until they are RELEASED, Thats right NO taking their CUT until its MY Money. This is plain Stupid BS, and I feel its going to end up like Netflix and their Blunder. But I promise this, I will hang a sign on it or post it on one of the many other places now avialable and Ebay can enjoy the "Interest gained" off of someone else. We should be paid for the Hold, A Bank cant do that anymore, But because PayPal is not a Banking Institution they do NOT have to play by the same rules as I was told by their PayPal CS Rep.

I can't believe PayPal. Cant believe Ebay lets them do this. Cant believe some people here defend this 21 day hold.

Not one store in the USA can you just walk in and say "give me the product now and I'll have my bank pay you in 21 days"

I dont ship nothing until paid, period, end of story. It's too risky. and paypal is refusing to pay people money that has been placed in their trust.

Paypal keeps having their operators read the same line over and over. That we have been paid when in fact we have not been paid a penny. Ok so if we have been paid then where is my money???? NO, we have not been paid. PAYPAL has been paid. Why in the world would I trust paypal more than a customer or vice versa. I mean what crack pipe are they smoking? Im not in business to build products so that paypal can be paid. They already get paid to handle the funds, but apparently they are in uncapable of transfering them from person to person.

We dont have any negatives, no complaints, so whatever it does not matter. It's totally not the point.

I have removed them from all listings and I would recommend you guys do as well.

Unfortunately I have had to notify customers of this problem that paypal is unwilling to pay us the money that they have entrusted to paypal. So far one customer was willing to lie and say that he had recieved an item we have not shipped. Then paypal released there money. FYI Paypal informed the buyer that this was the only way to get the funds release, not ME.

So your going to sit there an tell me this is to protect them or me? if you can honestly sit there and defend Paypals policy then you should take an ethics course.

I would not even start using them again if they called and told me they were removing this hold. Sometimes I can see the other sides point when I disagree, but there is no gray area here. This is a HUGE abuse of trust.

Seriously, who the heck is PAYPAL?

Some huge corporation with a CEO named Scott Thompson who makes god knows how much money. He's probably going to just end up in prison one day like Madolf and thousands of paypal users are just going to be out whatever money he had his hands at that point in time.

Rita--couple of things...eBay does not hold funds..only paypal does

Ask the people with the pickup only to leave feedback so that paypal will release the $$ but as Bob (I think it was) said, why use paypal and pay a fee when the people picking up the items can pay upon pick thus avoiding the fees and the holds.

Yes, there are holds and yes we don't like them but yes there are ways to get the holds removed quickly....

You do realize that when you or anyone pays with a credit card you have 60 days to dispute that charge correct? I can place an online order with any retailer, claim non receipt, file a dispute with my credit card company and win! The 21 day hold is nothing compared to the 60 day hold that you should be using to not touch the funds until a dispute can no longer be filed..eBay says 45 days but credit cards allow 60.

I spent several years working for a large charge card company in their customer service department and watched their customers day after day file disputes and win. Many admited that they had the item but that they were unhappy with the price they paid, so their account was credited, the merchant was charged back and unless that merchant bothered to respond (and you would be surprised how many don't for small $$ items (under $250) ) the credit would go back on the account and the merchant was out the $$ and the product.

One of my other ID's has a 21 day hold...I just ship quickly with delivery confirmation and never have I had the hold stay on longer than 6 days...its been 13 months with that ID but since its mainly a purchaser ID the hold has never been removed although I have probably sold 50 items on it..I use it as my slush fund incase of returns ect.

I don't understand as to why our money is held at all once the item has been shipped, recieved and feed back being good is completed! I think once this is established there really is no reason to with hold it. This is BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE to the SELLER who gave the GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE! I understand that at times there are ligit reasons to hold the money during a complaint or dispute. But once the customers feed back is established as good, there is no discussion or reason. I am new to all this but, I am trying to get started and while they are holding my money I'm in a state of limbo! When I'm selling on Craigs list to people I get my money in Cash right away or the transaction does not take place! Plus, I pay all my fees and Paypal takes my money at will whenever they want it for something! I think they should treat us the same way. Once transaction is complete "I WANT MY MONEY" PERIOD! A business cannot continue to operate when the funds are not flowing. I feel they, ebay and Paypal need to review their payout practices and CHANGE then to address the situations according to Customer satisfaction!

Im having the same problem as well. Im a fairly new eBayer, my first 3 transaction were items I sold, which was back in October of 2011, then I started buying since then.

All my payments are completed, no disputes, everything is confirmed. I keep seeing this as about sellers having this problem, but Ive been buying since for a while now and they slam me with this.

I work online and they pay us via paypal. This is going to beyond screw me for next week if they keep this on hold for 21 days, the holdhammer started today (Feb 26, 2012)

I check everything that they claimed they would put an account on hold and everything holds up on my end. 99% of the time I buy things online, 1% of the time sell. I dont understand why they would put a hold on a buyer's account.

This is beyond frustrating.

What a load of garbage. I just started an ebay and PayPal account, and nowhere was I informed of this when I signed up. How can I expand my business with no cash flow? I used to love ebay. I ran an ebay store for the Jaguar dealer I used to work for, and saw the huge earning potential. That's why I decided to get into this on my own. Imagine my surprise when, after buying $200 worth of merchandise, I find that on my first sale the funds are being held? I ship same or next day after payment, and bend over backwards for my buyers (even losing money to fix an issue with shipping). And don't get me started on ebay's catagory limit for new sellers. I've got a pile of video games that I can't sell until next month. Does ebay and PayPal even care that I am NOT new to this, and that I used to run an ebay store with $25,000 in monthly sales? NO! If something doesn't change soon, I'll have to find another site to sell my wares. Garbage. Pure garbage. Shame on you, ebay and PayPal. Shame...

i've been with ebay 10 years and had 100% top rated power seller status until oct 11 when some idiot buyer tried to screw me over and now my ratings have all gone to crap.

now i find, if this wasn't bad enough, that paypal and ebay have my funds on hold for 21 days becouse my five star shipping handling ratings do not meet their standards!

It is not bad enough they are also holding the money for the shipping costs so I haven't even got that money to pay to ship the items!

Oh paypal is owned by ebay as far as I know. And according to ebay policy you must accept them money orders no longer allowed. and me i wouldn't trust credit card or other payments from buyers -i've had one cancel a payment through a card and if it weren't for paypal i would never have gotten the money.

I suggest everyone selling to quit ebay for a few weeks or month -they can't make money with no sellers maybe then they won't be so "buyer" lovey.

15 years on Ebay---100 percent positive, 5 stars across the board, tracking numbers automatically added to all transactions, all transactions received. TODAY they put the 21 day hold on my account.

to boot, I'm also told that this will NOT just be for Ebay but for ALL PAYMENTS - even for private sales that are NOT Ebay sales.

I called Paypal and ripped them a new one - was told that in 35 days they will "reevaluate" my account. I said "SO in 35 days you're going to look at my 100 percent, 5 stars 15 year old account and THEN decide that it will be up to your standards??" He said "yes".

I asked why this was enacted, since I meet every single criteria and he said "Ebay did it". Well, I had already called Ebay and they said that my account should NOT have a hold on it - and that it was Paypal that did it.

Jerk.

So my question is this: Do I stop selling on Ebay completely and then will it just go away eventually? I sell on many other venues and am completely confused as to why funds from other sources will be held now, where they never were before, IF this is an "Ebay" thing.

Its not fair at all and its might not even be legal..

Paypal has to be registered as a Money Transmitter in your state

There are laws to help protect customers/hard working people from greedy corporations and banks.
Each state has different laws a Money Transmitter has to follow
Here in Califorina the max a payment processor/Money transmitter such as paypal can hold your funds is 3 Days
Check out your state in the fourm below and make a complaint with your state agency

The ebay SYI listing tool will remember the choices made from last listing you did. BUT..if you re-list an older item and forget to update, it defaults back to those older settings for all future listings.

AND...keep on your toes...every now and then, the SYI form will just default to old settings for no reason at all in a few of its fields.

If you use Turbo Lister or any other independent listing tool, you can set your preferences without fear of old defaults spring up on you.

Finally, sales are slowing down. I have everything shipped,

For me it is not just shipping. I have to do poroducion work. So sometimes i am happy when I have no pending orders that need supplies to be delivered and production work to be done before i can ship.

i saw those tv ads years ago where people were selling $14,000 a month on Ebay and only working 5 hours a week.

I know how you feel. I produce my own products too. Been really busy here. Not just ebay but, my website sales too. It's been about 50/50. And I wish that sales would slow down sometimes. Been putting in 10 - 12 hr.days for the past feew weeks and usually several hours on weekends too. I love the $$$ coming in though. Hope to catch a break here soon.

$14,000 a month 5 hours a week sounds really good right now. Heck, I'd even be happy with 5 hours a day.

That's awesome to hear! Steady business is always a good thing. Keep up the good work!

As I always say, "Be happy you have business while you do." I say that a lot these days since everything seems to be so up down up down.

As for the 5 hour a week, $14,000 yadda yadda. It's still on TV or something similar to it. I watched some of it a couple weeks ago and I couldn't stop laughing. Of course they were selling "Drop ship" information and you can work as little or as much as you want. They were doing the interview style infomercial. You had the author to the items being sold while talking to an interviewer. The funny thing was, the interviewer mentioned how easy it was to do about every 45 seconds.

Some regular posters on this board will tell you that is hard to do. I have been able to do it so far since 12/27/10, and it's NOT EASY. I often think i'm just lucky enough to do it.

I'll be back in a minute or 2, and maybe some others will be along shorty.

I pulled up your listings and sorry to be so blunt, but no sence beating around the bush......

I couldn't even read one description, as it was to jumbled, yet broken up in odd places. No Offence, but I had to click out fast. And since I'm trying to help and clicking out fast, what do you think potential buyers/bidders are doing?????
Bullet points are your friend, when used correctly Sometimes, less is more Some listings have the photo sideways Description area could use some cleaning and spell checked. (I'm often guity of not using spell check) One photo is blurry On returns, might want to rethink that, as ebay/paypal trump anything less than 45 days, and I think 14 days is going to be the minimum Batteries not included??? Something to think about, to out do your competition on. (Dollar stores have cheap batteries) that could be included, thus may bring more money for the item. Just something to dwell upon, and remember to account for the added shipping weight if you decide to include them. In all honesty, when looking at your listings, starting from the top and working down........The description area gets better. All could still use some reworking though.

Hope that helps

I only suggested it. The best thing to do is research your competition and "see" if they are doing it. If "not", that could give you an advantage even if it means raising your price to cover the added cost. + That could be a selling point to focus on.

Toooooo many sellers are playing the price cutting game, and it's a shame. I have posted several times, that I DO sell certain items for 2 - 3 times more, than the average price (sold or NOT) that shows when researching completed listings.

Since you have more than 1. So you could use 1 as a test listing, to see which way buyers like it.

Click the following link to a quick search I did for one of your items. Then look at 5 different ones in that search result. Don't worry about the border, inserted photos' or all the other garbage. Don't copy them, Just look at how they described the item, and pay attention to how they layed the description out. Your looking for ideas on how to lay out your description(s)........

Hi &amp; wishing you well in your ebay selling!

As always, you already received some great suggestions from other members and some of this might be repetitive:

Checked your completed items and....

Have you considered selling your multiple, identical items under one listing? If you are ok with a desired buy it now price that has worked well in the past, it will save you a lot of listing fees to list identical items together in one listing.

Consider listing your items "Good till cancelled" -- low insertion fee for you and will still show up in search results. This is also a time saver for you to tweek existing listings more effectively to increase sales

Add a few more descriptive details/keywords to your title?
For instance, with your freeline skates, your title does not mention + CD -- that may separate you from competition.

Wishing you well and many, many sales!

<post author="luckycrater" datetime="2012-02-28T12:21:00" id="p10">
the first thing I do when looking at items of interest is to check the " auction" box to eliminate all of the ' buy it now' listings, and then I check the " used" item box to get rid of the new item listings. eBay for me was and is always about people selling things they no longer want, and less about people getting rich from working eBay full time like a retail store.
If eBay continues in the trend of being infested with high minimum bid retail like resale outlets, then me, and many like me will abandon eBay for garage sales, thrift stores, and Craigslist.

Hi,

Nobody is going to give you their sources.

You are going to have to find them on your own.

There are plenty out there but most of them are more trouble than they are worth.

There are also a very few that are good suppliers but you have to realize, when dropshipping, the profit margin is VERY thin and you have to be on top of them all the time, monitoring their inventory.

People find a dropshipper, sign up and then list, list, and list! They list soooo much but then when it comes to monitoring the inventory they do not check back into the site to see if the inventory is still available.

You CAN have a successful business with dropshippers but it is W*O*R*K.

It is not E*A*S*Y.

I found all my sources by surfing the net on my cellphone during commercials, while waiting in line, any spare moment.

Search several different ways, most do not even have the word "dropship" on their site.

Good Luck.

My partners and I refuse to use dropshipping. If a dropshipper has 100 items for example and we sell 107 to 107 different people then we have 7 potential unhappy customers with the potential for 7 negative feedbacks. A dropshipper is only concerned with selling their 100 items as fast as they can. I am concerned with selling the 100 items that are in our inventory as best and correctly as possible. This is just my opinion.....

More buyer know the system can be gamed in their favor than ever before. Its now about knowing this in advance as a seller and having the pieces in place to deal with it in advance.

Its the cost of doing business on ebay. If the numbers dont work out in advance with this in mind, then the model wont work.

Thats the beauty of ebay, either it works or it doesnt. But easy to figure out ahead of time.

Call it snobbery...call it delusion...but just by the nature of my niche of vintage and collectable trinkets, I believe my customers are more discriminating.than most and often pay a premium above the going market rate. They aren't buying flash drives, DVDs or any other commodity. They're buying something unique, and more often than not, they're not buying my item per se, but a memory...something really special to them.

As such, I expect them to demand nothing but the best and I try to cultivate that attitude in them, making them want to become repeat customers for things that no one in their right minds really needs. Perhaps "requiring" them to be demanding was a bad word choise, but I truly expect them to be. It's very important to me.

I take great pride in what I sell and how it's sold, whether it's a $5, $50 or $500 trinket, and I treat everyone and every sale the same, as if my customer is the only person in the world and my trinket is the only item I'll ever sell. I don't consider this something to be given neither personally nor professionally. I consider it a "given"...period...just another part of the basic no-frills package of dealing with me.

Is low feedback going to hold me back when it comes to Wholesaling business
</headline>
<post author="xilyn" datetime="2012-02-27T21:09:00" id="p1">
Help ! I am quite new to ebay and recently decided to start wholesaling on ebay with the intention for some potential revenues to help pay for college loans. The only problem is i have only 5 feedbacks so far. Although they are all positive, i have noticed that all the ebay wholesalers have over thousands of feedback. Does having low feedback means noone will buy from me? Should i be dissuaded from my low feedbacks to not start this wholesaling business and wait until i have more?

Hello and welcome to this board.

1st) I would keep using your 50 free auction listings untill you get the hang of listing and selling

2nd) Try buing a few inexpensive items from sellers that give FB right away or at least once you've posted + for them. They are easy to spot.

3rd) When buying from those sellers, buy packing and shippng supplies you know you will need. Some really good suppliers sell here. Remember though, if you buy multiple items from a single seller, spead thoughs purchases out. Buy 1 item at a time every 8 days, so each FB received will count.

4th) use the search box at the top of this page to search past topics on questions you may have. Chances are they've been answered over and over and over. Read all the replies in those threads, as there is some really good advice posted.

5th) Come back and post any questions or concerns you may have, that you couldn't find answers to thru the search. Many are here to help. They wont give away secrets, but they will help where they can.

6th) You'll know after selling for a while, when it's time to actually open a store, untill then continue to use the 50 free auction listings.

7th) Get familiar with shipping rates, weights and shipping types, IE Bubble mailers, priority, Flate rate Boxes, Rate A, B &amp; C boxes. Understand how and when you should use each one and when. Also, INVEST in a postage scale, they can be obtained here for 11.oo - 30.oo. Many sellers loose money on shipping, because they don't have a scale or they don't understand all the options avaliable to them or even how to use those options to their advantage.

Hope this helps for now.

Understanding, "One is just the middleman for the collection &amp; forwarding of all fees &amp; postage", is the first step to avoid paying them out of pocket.

Having low feedback means different things to some.

Some will prey on you thinking you're new and you have no idea what you're doing and will try to get items for free. Delivery Confirmation should take care of this and it's free if you print your postage online. SC for items over $250 including shipping. If you get a SNAD, respond with this, full refund upon return. Don't just hand out refunds like candy.

Some will think that you don't have the experience to sell so some might be hesitant to buy from you. There are many things to consider but I'm sure you'll catch up soon enough. Might want to search the boards for old topics. Horror stories? Answer Center is your best bet.

Everybody on ebay started at zero feedback, so don't get discourage by that. My question is don't you have limitations with ebay and paypal..paypal holding your money? so if they hold your money will you have the necessary funds to ship your wholesale lot?

We have been selling for a bit now and paypal has been holding unto our funds..yesterday we had our 3rd review to see if they will lift the limitations out but they did not they extended that sucker again until March 27th and when asked why we were told they had no idea Great!!! thanks!! so we have been paying for shipping out of our own pockets...so you may want to think about that if you have any restrictions.

There is a misunderstading about funds being held. Even if your funds are held, when you print a label from ebay the neccessary funds for the shipping amount are released. In other words, your profits are withheld. Ebay/paypal allow label purchase to ensure speedy shipment.

That's correct if Ebay is the one giving you the limitations. When we were pretty new ebay had limitations and they allowed us to print the label and pay later but once they lift that up, we still had paypal holding our funds..so we print our labels from paypal..they take the funds each time from our bank account, the item gets delivered and we get our funds released 24 hours later so we get our funds about 5 days later.

Discount Fishers
</headline>
<post author="404bargainhunter" datetime="2012-02-25T20:52:00" id="p1">
Does anyone else have an issue with discount fishers? I have had a rash of people asking for discounts once they receive an item. One in particular was a new suite I sold from J-Crew and it still had the tags which stated "black" and the buyer said it was navy and demanded a discount or a return with me paying the return shipping. Although she did not say she would leave me negative feedback it was greatly implied. This is greatly impacting my business and I don't know how to address it other than give in to these discount grubbers. Any suggestions?

<post author="laurentng" datetime="2012-02-25T21:50:00" id="p2">
First there are many different way of dealing with this and really there is no right or wrong way.It will all depend on you, what this business mean to you, what you consider fair or too much.
But I will tell you a few thing that will help you decide,
If she open a case,you will have no choice but to accept a return and refund you do not have enough volume to deal with the unwanted low DSR the DSR rating for low volume seller is for 1 year if you are put below standred you sale will drop 60%or more I am not sure how much of this you understand.but I can tell you that if will hurt you alot more then whatever the money is on that sale Now,what to do is up to you, You have enough sale under your belt to know the different between what you want and what you need to do. I hope this help.

<post author="rosachs" datetime="2012-02-25T22:38:00" id="p3">
Do you have a stated returns policy in your listings? If not, you should - it would have answered your buyer's question before they asked... even before they purchased. If it was their intent to purchase and then push for a lower price due to some 'flaw', knowing what your return policy was may have sent them looking for another "opportunity". Just as locking the doors on your car will send the casual car thief moving on to the next, possibly unlocked vehicle.

It also helps when it comes to dealing with eBay/PayPal -- having a policy in place means the buyer is creating issues by not following those guidelines you already put in place. Makes it easier for them to say "look - the seller has already stated they will refund you money when you return the item. So just return it already!"

As to dealing with those already pushing -- simply offer a full refund when they return the item in the condition received. Meaning all tags in place, unworn, unwashed, still in shrinkwrap, sealed/undamaged box, etc. No mention of a partial refund anywhere in sight. Period.

And do ALL COMMUNICATIONS VIA EBAY MAIL -- this give eBay an accepted track of the communications. eBay/PayPal do NOT accept outside email, which is likely how the buyer contacted you about the "discount". Because they know eBay won't even look at that message. Only what shows in eBay Mail counts... so keep your conversation there. If they don't want to reply to you that way after you contact them there.... it's pretty much certain they are fishing for free money and know the rules they have to play by to make it work.

Good luck... and better sales!

I personally don't and won't cave in to give a partial refund. I offer a 30 day "No questions ask" 100% money back return policy. Out of 1500+ transactions, I only had 4 buyers return thjeir items, and all was well (FB + DSR's).

I look at it this way; All questions about the item should have been done before the purchase, and any negotiations about price based on questions asked should have also been done prior to purchase.

In the OP's case; the buyer wanted and purchased based on the color of the jacket. I ask: how is a 10.oo-20.oo partial refund going to change the color of the jacket, or make it an acceptable color to keep?

I would relpy;

Dear " buyer"

I'm sorry to hear that your not happy with the color of this jacket, as stated by the manufacture. Please return it to us for a full refund of your purchase price paid + original shipping. Your refund will appear in you paypal account within 24 hours of our receiving the item.

Thank you.
"Your name"

You will know rather quickly, whether they are not happy with the color or they were just fishing for the partial refund.

Which is why you guy are seeing me responds to less and less to newbie, Since my answer are usually 3 question ahead of them they don;t even know what I am talking about, the only time they will know is when they run into problem a month or 2 down the road. by the time they figure out that I might be able to help...... I stop responding to them.
I now give newbie 2 chance, after that I let then do what they will end up doing.. I think that too is part of the learning Ebay process, after awhile you just don;t want to help them anymore, let them bang their head on wall like we did when we first started. if they're smart enough to stop and listen,,fine, if not let nature take its course.,,,,,,,

like those seller who insist on asking the same question but never bother to change then come back after a few week asking basically the same question, thinking that it is a different question.. they really shouldn't;t be selling, if you cannot understand that you do not have a business by losing money on shipping or you do not have profit if you make $1 on a sale, hey why bother to teach them,,,..... le then find out for themselves.

I am a buyer with 100% positive feedback and comments about my honesty and general wonderfulness as a buyer. I tried to sell a few things and started out listing my son's Fossil watch. Great watch, in working, like new condition. I follow all the advice to list low so it will generate interest. Basically, only one scamming moron was interested and he got the watch for 15 dollars. He then began a campaign of lies (...it doesn't work, the band has been altered, etc.) to get the watch free. He said he'd keep the watch if I'd pay to get a new band put on, implying that I had a "not as described" case. Like he was trying to blackmail me into giving him the watch free. I told him to "go for it", which he did. Ebay gave that lying scammer his money back, but didn't hold it against me. He should have never been given his money back as this only encourages him to do this to people again and again. I spent an inordinate amount of time fooling around over 15.00, but I wasn't going to be taken advantage of.I have no plans to be a seller if this is the type of thing one has to deal with. He is just an online thief, as far as I'm concerned.

Unfortunatly, you didn't handle the situation properly.

1st) You should NEVER EVER EVER "advise or entice" a buyer to open a SNAD claim. Did I mention....... NEVER EVER EVER ?

2nd) You should have simply asked -via- ebay messaging, the buyer to return it to you for a full refund. You could have then, once you got it back, relisted for more money.

3rd) Since a claim was opened, you should have stated in the claim for the buyer to RETURN the item for a full refund. Ebay/paypal would have then required said buyer to retun it to you, before giving them their refund.

Sorry that happened, but maybe the above will help should the situation arise again.

For me, I wouldn't have cared what the story was or how the pope said it needed a new this or that. My respond would of been.....

FULL REFUND UPON RETURN.

If buyer opened a SNAD case, I would of responded with....

FULL REFUND UPON RETURN.

That would of been my response to everything and nothing else until I turned blue in the face. I would responded with it over and over and over and over again. Yep, that would of been me.

I would not take it back because he said it wasn't working.It left this house in perfect order and who knows what he's doing? Using it for parts? Why didn't he purchase insurance?

You do understand that it's not the buyers responsibility to purchase insurance, in fact it's against ebay policy to charge the buyer for it.

It is however, the sellers resposibility to get the buyer the item(s) they purchased in good condition and as described in the listing.

I've only been back to eBay for just over a year now, and I offer a 30 Day "No Questions Asked" return. So far, out of 1600 transactions, i've only had to refund 5 times, and thats due to buyers buying the wrong size and such. So for 5 no hassle returns, i've gained 5 loyal repeat customers.

KIMIGO--WELCOME! Everyone is giving you great advice and I just wanted to add what I noticed from your initial comment...you have 100% feedback as a BUYER...all Buyers have 100% feedback because sellers can no longer out a buyer for being bad..just as the buyer you have encountered.

NEVER start an auction at a price lower than you want to sell it for just to "entice" bidding/attraction. That worked with old eBay but with the eBay of today, as you found out you will probably only get 1 or 2 bids so its best not to sell for a loss until you want to lose $$.

I hope this one buyer doesn't scare you away. Read this board and you will find many tricks to being successful.

I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure--which is: Try to please everybody. Herbert Bayard Swope

Kimigo - I would stop selling immediately until you understand how ebay works... READ THESE BOARDS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN! Like Bob (Rosachs) always says, "Take a notebook and write a topic on each page" and from that make notes to yourself and use it as a CHEAT SHEET for each topic listed. If you have questions about something you have read make a note and ask us later. It's guaranteed to help you out.

Once you understand more about selling then I would give it a shot again... Selling can be fun if you understand how to play the game and how to deal with buyers. Or selling can be a total loss if you don't put the energy in to learn.

There are many rules that need to be followed in order to be a profitable seller. Until you understand the basics - Don't list ANYTHING.

After you have read the boards over and over and over again and still have questions THEN start a thread and we will be more than happy to give you pointers. We are all here to help you but you need to take the first step and help yourself learn the basics. Good luck! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/grin.gif" alt=":-D"/>

kimigo1959,

It stinks that your first sale was to a scammer. But don't give up. I sell on another account (~240 sales so far) and have yet to have
a bad buyer.

I've heard that electronics and jewelry attract scammers. Try selling low priced, non-scammer attracting items while you learn the selling ropes. There's lots of advice here on how to find such items.

If you do run into another scammer, ask ebay to check his history. I read elsewhere that if a buyer has a history of SNADs, claims of items not received (or received an empty box), etc., ebay will be more likely to protect the seller. Just like ebay tracks sellers' history, they can track buyers history, even if they use different accounts.

Good luck, and don't give up just yet! There's always room for another good, honest seller here. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

Does anyone else have an issue with discount fishers? I have had a rash of people asking for discounts once they receive an item. One in particular was a new suite I sold from J-Crew and it still had the tags which stated "black" and the buyer said it was navy and demanded a discount or a return with me paying the return shipping. Although she did not say she would leave me negative feedback it was greatly implied. This is greatly impacting my business and I don't know how to address it other than give in to these discount grubbers. Any suggestions?

Thank you, and everyone, for the advice. It appears that, from the comments, that I have a new game to learn. I have been a business owner most of my working life, but the rules of retail seem different here on ebay. I will have to get that figured out before I go any further with any sort of online business. Being not much of a game-player, but more of a straight-shooter, I'm not that equipped to see this stuff coming. I mean, the original post said the woman thought the suit "looked blue to her" when the tag said that its black. How is a seller supposed to deal with THAT? I think it didn't fit or something and she's trying to make it look like its on him that it looks blue to her. I am good to my customers and they are good to me, but on the rare occasion that I get someone who wants to make a problem where one doesn't exist to get a discount or even get something free, that's where I draw the line and send them on their way. I don't care if they are happy or not and I sure don't want them coming back. I'm hearing ya'll say that this will be the death of an ebay business because sellers can't ever give bad feedback (WHAT???) and buyers are always lording the 'Not As Described' accusation over their heads. Even the use of the phrase, 'open a case against you' sounds like a legal term meant to intimidate. OH NO! We don't want A CASE AGAINST US. Jeez.

Hi guys, I got this email today from a buyer :

Dear jeslie2011,

Received the model exactly as described, but found it's quite a bit off scale. Not your fault, it says 1/25 on the box but is smaller, more like 1/29 or 1/30. As a collector, correct scale is very important to me, so I would like to return it. It's a great and rare item so you should have no trouble selling it to some other collector. Please confirm.

Cheers

I emailed him back asking him if he has opened the bag because the kit was sealed...my hubby says he doesn't feel like we should refund, I said if it is still mint take it back I don't want another neg....opinions? ideas? options?

What do you want to do?

Buyer sounded very reasonable to me so full refund upon return if I was in your situation.

OR, buyer can go over your head and file a claim with Paypal which goes against you and a whole bunch of headaches along with it.

Up to you how you want to deal with it. Either way, the buyer will win hands down.

I can see a neg coming lol my husband is reluctant to refund..he says item was as decribed but because He ( the buyer) feels that way we should not send it back. I keep telling him what I learned here but he won't budge lol he is upset about it. (sigh) oh well. My concern is that if he opened the kit then we won't get anything close to what it's value was this is an old car and if he opened the bag I won't know if all the parts are there. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/cry.gif" alt=":_|"/>

It does take time to learn to deal with these feeling but they are the things you must learn to deal with mentally to get to the next level.

he should agree on the return and refund....not sure if my opinion count but,I would

I would issue a full refund upon return of the item. It's tuff to be a seller sometimes we have to take our hits.
The buyer didn't say he opened the package did he?
I had a buyer ship me back a glass compote antique that broke in the shipping, and she didn't place insurance on it as i did when i mailed it to her. It was not her problem so she said. I refuned the money and ate the loss just to keep the peace and my rating, which is where ebay has us sellers by the balls
It's tuff to be a good seller without taking your losses.

Sorry but your hubby is 100% wrong on this. Your listing has a 14 day refund policy, eBay has a 45 day buyer guarantee and credit cards offer 60 days to dispute charges. If you don't accept the return and then fully refund the buyer will still get it and you will get a ding from eBay. The goodnews is that since you do have a return policy the buyer does have to return the item, if you didn't then eBay could take the $$ from you, give it to the buyer and tell the buyer to keep the item.

The box was already open but did the buyer open the packaging inside (hopefully not)

Yes, that's the car. The box says the scale which is how we advertised the kit. I told my husband I am all for refunding the dude washing my hands and get whatever I get back and perhaps get my money back on the toy alone ( 2.00 dollars) and not get dinged. So I emailed the buyer asking if he has opened the bag with the parts in it ( this is where it gets tricky) if he opened the bag I will give him his money back but doubt I would be able to resell since I won't know if all the parts are there and then I will have another issue in my hands if I sell it and they are not all there. I told him to leave customer service to me. I put the 14 day retun there because that is what I learned here <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/> another thank you! if the buyer does not reply in the next couple of days should I let it go and wait or email him and asked him if he changed his mind?

<post author="coketag" datetime="2012-02-26T07:28:00" id="p2">
Meant to help, not tear apart..........

Please get away from ALL CAPS, it's harder to read Try staying with 1 font style for all listings Use of way to many colors &amp; bolding for descriptions Add more detail to descriptions Text in descriptions is HARD to read when all is bolded Some pictures need to be rotated right side up, Hard to look at when item photo is sideways Adding more photos: Back and close-ups fo detail would help Most importantly.......The photo's of the clothing that has a garden hose in the background, makes the item really unappealing.

Don't mean to harp on this, but..............

Having a "No Returns" policy is probably also killing you from getting bids. Ebay/paypal 45 day buyer protection Trumps "No Returns" everyday of the week, and buyers know this. It tells them you don't stand behind the product your trying to sell. Sort of like: take it or leave it, and they are leaving it.

Dealing with Postage:

I notice your using shipping cost numbers like; 1.oo, 2.oo and such. Note: Postage 99.9999999999999% of the time never works out to an exact.00 number, so let me ask:
Do you know what these items weigh, as if packaged ready to ship? Do you also know that ebay is going to charge you 9% of your shipping charge collected from your buyer? Do you even know that right now, USPS FC shipping minimum with DC# when printed online is 1.64 for just a 1 ounce package? Your going to Loose money out of profits if you don't research your shipping costs for each item, before listing it. Going by what you have listed now, I would just add your stated shipping costs of 1.oo-2.oo to your items price and list as Free Shipping. Your have to pay FVF's on shipping no matter what side of the fence it's on. Might as well get the auto 5 stars -v- letting buyers ding you. Even though your shipping cost is well below actual costs, they will still ding, so why give them that chance?

One thing to remember: Items will not always get bids or sell the first, second, third, fourth or even fifth time around. Patience is key, and without it, you will drive yourself crazy. So relax, improve the look of you auctions, get familiar with shipping rates and over time you'll see an improvement.

But, in the same listing, you drive most potential bidders away. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/sad.gif" alt=":("/>

Understanding, "One is just the middleman for the collection &amp; forwarding of all fees &amp; postage", is the first step to avoid paying them out of pocket.

Tape some paper over that brick wall or, place the clothing flat on a table top covered with white background for darker clothing and black or dark blue background for light colored items.

You'll also need to describe in detail the condition of your pre-owned clothing within the items description. If they are in like new condition then mention it in the listing. If there are any flaws whatsoever then you need to clarify that as well. Also, put the size in the listing as well as the title.

Throw the clothing into a dryer to dewrinkle or actually iron the clothing (if applicable to the particular clothing) or at least lay them out flat for a while to get wrinkles out before taking pics.

Lose the bright colored font. It's a bit distracting. Use black font.

It's a lot of work but, since they can't actually see the clothing like at a yard sale or flea market, you need to take top notch photos with detailed descriptions.

Once you get rolling, you realize there is a big difference in "selling some stuff" -v- "getting multiple bidders paying more for your items or paying what they are really worth".

One thing that might help.

Try doing a search for items that are like the ones your selling or are planning on listing for sale. Once you've brought up the search results, click the check box next to "Completed listings". Once thoughs results come up, take a moment to look at the ones that did sell. Look for and at how they listed, Don't copy, but get some ideas as to how they listed and presented their item. Then incorporate your own personal ideas/touches into your listings.

After looking at the ones that did sell, take a moment to look at the ones that didn't sell. You'll see a big difference in listing styles. (Take into account, that not ALL items will sell or be bid on).

I'm currently, on another ID, testing some ideas. I'm actually getting 2 to 3 times more for the same item, than the competition is getting. Example: Items from other sellers are selling or not selling at 9.oo on the average. I'm selling the same exact item consistantly (depending on the brand and new -v- pre-owned) at 18.oo - 39.oo, and getting it repeatedly with NO problems. I just can't find enough to keep up with the demand for what i'm selling.

Understanding, "One is just the middleman for the collection &amp; forwarding of all fees &amp; postage", is the first step to avoid paying them out of pocket.

It's not my intention to put you down or trying to take you down or anything BUT.....

Clothing is very saturated here on eBay meaning MANY, MANY SELLERS sells clothing and unless you know what's hot and what's not...you're out of luck. Not to mention your feedback is very low. Clothing is not a good idea to auction off unless it's one of a kind otherwise it's a dud, I hope you know what I mean.

What you also have to keep in mind is that majority of the masses have different styles and taste in terms of clothing. Honestly, I think, clothing is best sold via FP instead of auction but that's just me.

If clothing for women and children are good items to sell, why don't I have more bids? How do you all build your business and deal with the shipping costs?

</quote>

Everybody has given great advice...I buy clothes on ebay and as a buyer I seldom buy one shirt or an outfit...perhaps selling them by the lots would be more profitable. Also pricing.. example your disney pajama set i could get that at walmart for 13 bucks brand new or a 3 pc pajama set for 6 bucks on sale...so like others said knowing what sells is prime.

Also selling clothing on ebay has a lot of competition so maybe you want to find your niche...either selling children clothes, or teenagers or adults and concentrate in one of them.

For me a buyer ( it may not be for everybody) I have saved sellers who only sell children's clothing because I buy a lot for my daughter...those that have a mix of many I don't because it is too much for me to go thru or whatever call me lazy but those are some of my quirkiness as a buyer haha but they all have them.

Yep your feedback needs to be up and as a new seller myself take advantage of buy it nows and free listings...if you know the value of the clothes do buy it nows.

Good luck <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

Do you know what these items weigh, as if packaged ready to ship? Do you also know that ebay is going to charge you 9% of your shipping charge collected from your buyer? Do you even know that right now, USPS FC shipping minimum with DC# when printed online is 1.64 for just a 1 ounce package? Your going to Loose money out of profits if you don't research your shipping costs for each item, before listing it. Going by what you have listed now, I would just add your stated shipping costs of 1.oo-2.oo to your items price and list as Free Shipping. Your have to pay FVF's on shipping no matter what side of the fence it's on. Might as well get the auto 5 stars -v- letting buyers ding you. Even though your shipping cost is well below actual costs, they will still ding, so why give them that chance?

Hi! A few suggestions for you...

Your titles need more descriptive words-- including size, gender, Do not worry about material (i,e, cotton, polyester) in your subject line, unless it is leather, fur, etc-- something high end. Save that for item details or description Try laying your items flat on the ground for pics-- I usually sell new with tag items but sold used items for YEARS -- and still do on occassion -- feel free to check out my listings. Hangers don't look that appealing to most Try selling same sized items in Lots -- easier for you and more appealing to buyers Take the time to write better desciptions -- are they in fair (play clothes) or excellent used condition? I offer 1st class &amp; priority shipping -- you can loose a lot of money by not knowing item weight with low priced items-- and I am seeing many items shipping for $1 lol You're new, we all have been there and have no doubt that you will do well. : ) Try not to get discouraged easily, offer great customer service, know your competition and hang in there : )

Wishing you all the best!

Garment size should be in the title, lots of people search by size.
Wiyth clothing, measurements are key, at least chest or waist measurement and length.
Keep an eye on store sale papers for prices, people can sometimes buy new for less than some used prices.
Best thing i ever got was a postal scale, that way you can use the calculated shipping.

And if you have questions, posters on all these boards are very quick (and nice!!) to help.

Everytime I hear people talk about these "learn ebay" programs they bought, it's a rip off plain and simple
And most will also try to sign you up with a dropshipping company.

The best way to learn ebay, is to do ebay...start small and learn the ins and outs...please don't give your hard earned money to these people!

You dont need college to become a powerseller, it happens by selling, not by schooling. It will happen eventually. A better college course might be how to avoid being ripped off and how to ship and insure and deal with problems.

dartdiggler24 - if you post that with a selling ID that shows results backing up you claim, you might come across credible. A 2 month old ID with one sale for $10 does not match well with your 'raking in the cash' statement.

My grandma invested in to Power seller college about 2 months ago, and she is making a little over 1500.00 profit a month. I used to sell on ebay all the time, and made a nice little bit of money, but lost access to the products I was selling. I spent about a month trying to help get her set-up with a seller account and find some products to sell through dropshippers, and wholesalers without any luck.
Now the student is becoming the teacher, and I'm looking forward to learning more from her.
If anyone wants to know, she is over 60 yrs old, no experience on ebay.... and limited experience on the computer. I don't know how much she invested, but she seems to be very happy with the help that she is receiving for them.

Hope this helps.

Okay, for the sake of protecting small business and frankly my general life ethics...

Here's the way to find it free and on EBAY!!! This will teach you more than any Power Seller college... You'd do a better service for the world giving all that money to a charity. SOOO... if there is actually anyone out there who didn't know about these, and it helped you, consider giving a few bucks to cause in need as a thank you. Or list an item here in a charity auction for heaven's sake!

In the top Left Hand corner, hover on "SELL", then click on "Seller Information Center" and after the page loads you will see a left hand navigation bar in the window with "Growth Strategies". Everything you need to know can be found there.

Geez... chances are you spend all the $, and they tell you to go to the same place. Classic Pyramid scheme. Tell grandma not to spend any more money on 3rd party "instructors".

It's easy to believe that there's some 'secret' to profitable selling on eBay, but there's not. It's not secret - it's public knowledge willingly shared by any active seller: buy low, sell high! Doesn't help, you say? Then you didn't understand it.... so let's look at that again.... Buy low. Simple, really. Buy your product for the absolutely lowest price you can. But how do you know what's really a low price, and what's just some hype being pumped at you to make a sale (your supplier wants to make a sale too, you know!)? Ahh.... this is where the research comes in, the 'secret' part of buying low. Research to see what your items will sell for, then research what it will cost you to sell it, then determine how much profit you want to make, add it all up, and that becomes your purchasing price. You have to buy, and have delivered, at or below that price: Selling price less selling costs less acquisition costs less profit desired equals purchase point. Buy at or below that cost, and if the rest of your math was accurate, you'll sell for a profit. Sell high -- that's even more simple. It means getting the best price for your product. And again, here's the 'secret' part no one tells you about: research. Search for your product on a few search engines - what do you find? Check out general shopping comparison sites - what do you find? Don't just check eBay - check other venues as well.... because your buyers will be! Research your best location to sell.... and you probably want to make this pre-purchase rather than post-purchase. That is... find the best place to sell your widget, where you will get the best price, but keep your eye on all the low-ball sites. You may find buying from site A is the perfect place to acquire inventory for selling on site B. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/> See? It's no big secret! Buy Low - Sell High! The 'secret', the thing no one wants to do or talk about, is RESEARCH. The more you know, the more power you have. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/> -Bob.

I just heard of them through a friend in Connecticut who told me she paid them $3,000. (I see it is actually more than that!). They sold her a bill of goods and she is going for it. They also will do all her bookkeeping, etc. OMG. I can't wait to see how this all turns out. I am afraid for her but can't say much until I see what happens. She has been a teacher all her life and has never done any retail or been in the business world.

She didn't even know she could get priority mail boxes sent to her by the post office or that there was a discount for shipping. I am sick just thinking about it. She asked me a few questions about my business which I have been doing for seven+ years.

Ebay gives all the help you need for free.

The 'secret', the thing no one wants to do or talk about, is RESEARCH. The more you know, the more power you have. Yeah, that problem is part of a much larger problem in our society - the instant gratification mentality, which leads many people to think that they can accomplish a great deal in a ridiculously short amount of time or that you can pay for some product or service and things will just change right away and you'll be a runaway success. This has certainly been exacerbated by tough economic times, but has been around since even before the current recession began. With rare exceptions, it takes work and commitment to build something of value, such as a successful business. Most "overnight success" stories have years of hard work behind them. Unfortunately, a lot of people are in denial about this. And that's why scammers offering instant success and the like continue to pop up and take money from so many unfortunate people (who, I might add, don't even bother to research the folks they're handing over their thousands to....). <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/cool.gif" alt="B-)"/> Sallie

" Sounds like they are selling crap. The best way to learn ebay, is to do ebay....this program has done alot for me......she seems to be very happy with the help that she is receiving for them. Everything you need to know can be found there. " These are all probably true statements though some are more opinion than fact. Each of the posters likely believes in what they are saying. But one could say much the same about almost any seller here... " Sounds like they are selling crap. Don't buy from a crook on eBay. You can get the same stuff at any area yard sale cheaper....or even Goodwill for a fraction of the eBay cost. Don't bid on auctions; sellers are all shilling. " The fact is, however, most eBay sellers are honest, offering something of value for a fair price. They took the time to source it and make it available where the buyer can easily find it, choose it, and have it shipped directly too them. Some shoppers don't have the time, or the desire, to spend their Saturdays traipsing around neighborhoods hoping to find what they are looking for. In a similar way some people are more comfortable with a formal course or with someone to guide them in the learning process. They need to be told what to do (often repeated in different ways) in order to be able to effectively learn and do what others can read and apply easily on their own. Yes, there are scams, and yes, there are over-priced courses and instruction programs. There are also dishonest eBay sellers and over-priced junk being offered here. But, just as there are mostly good sellers offering fairly priced merchandise, there are also good courses that aren't scams. YOU may not need one but others may. What they will pay is determined in pretty much the sane way a seller gets paid for their items listed on eBay; what the market will bear. I'm not sure why but way back when the word wide web was first introduced I found it very easy to learn and apply HTML. I was never good with languages in school but the contcept of HTML, and later PHP, just seemed to fall into place for me. There weren't many sources of information -- the web was brand new and the books hadn't yet been printed. But I found the information, and learned, for free. Not long after that I began to have people ask me to teach them. I've offered courses (both free courses and paid courses!) on a number of related topics and had many hundreds of students over the last 15 years or so tell me how satisfied they were and how they learned easily with my teaching style. I've also been told my courses are a scam because you can get all the information on how to create an eBay template or website for free online. The second part of that is absolutely true. You can get the information for free -- though I've also seen a lot of crap advice being offered as gospel. For some, too, the understanding will come easy. For others, though, they need to be guided though it. They need someone they can go to regularly to ask questions and receive answers that are provided in a way they can understand and without the worry of being rudely attacked or belittled as some are when they ask basic questions. For some, a course (or college ) is the better way to learn. And to suggest that any such a course, without having seen it, is nothing more than a scam is to clearly show why some people can't find the answers they need here even if the information is free. I don't know Power Seller College at all. Lora and I got to be Power Sellers on our own in the same way we do most things -- we researched, read, asked questions, filtered and applied what we learned. It was cheaper in dollars than the courses we saw at the time but it was expensive in time. We had to decide which was better for us. But I've taken courses, too. I've spent a lot of money on them. The biggest scams, in my opinion, are the formal, sanctioned courses at community colleges and universities I've attended, along with the over-priced text books the professors are flogging. But that's the game you play to get the diplomas or degrees. Personally, I'd look at any course, Power Seller College included, and weigh the benefits and costs in light of my own learning style and see if it delivered what I needed and then decide whether or not to take it. I probably wouldn't. I have neither the spare cash nor the desire to ever become a Power Seller again. But some, the OP included, may consider the advice they are getting in this thread and decide such a course is right for them. That's their choice. What they do with the course information will be their choice too. Whatever you choose, good luck!

These discussion boards are indexed on Google. They generate lots of new content, with each post actually. They move up the search results quickly. So what better way to promote a scam than to start discussing it on an active board and then use other bogus IDs to make phony and/or unsubstantiated claims to keep the discussion going and promoting the scam? Problem is... anyone who reads the discussion thread is less likely to be scammed. Hmmmm........ -Bob.

Their market research is top notch it tells you everything you need to know before even listing an item. Thats my two cents on powerseller college but it depends on how serious you are about what income or if this is another source of income you want to make!! <img src="images/quote-right.gif"/>

Most of this makes no sense? I'm confused Look I can write what I want and it will be posted. There are always going to be people that are happy working for others and those that have something bigger in mind for themselves. I am new to eBay and this hasn't helped at all.

I have been an internet business owner for 10 years and eBay is a great tool for those who are getting started. They have millions of visitors a day and believe me traffic is expensive and takes a lot of time. But please go with your heart, it won't fail you. I know for a fact mentoring is a great thing and it has shortened my learning curve by far... Find what you want to do and find the person or company that can help you... Yes! All of the info you need is already on the internet but don't plan on making a full time income from home for many years, plan on a lot of reading... And stop buying programs that say you can get rich with $40.00.

And don't listen to people that aren't successful! Hope that helps!

I want facts and figures not BS.
</post>
<post author="rosachs" datetime="2011-01-07T12:17:00" id="p53">
I want facts and figures not BS. If all you are hearing about a service is "bad press", there are usually only a couple of valid reasons why: - the service actually is bad. - the service is over-hyped and under-delivered, which most people would consider a bad thing. Consider -- Company A is offering training for some online activity, charging a set-up/registration fee along with a monthly fee. The fees are charges auto-magically to your credit card or bank acount. The sign-up process is easy and promises to make the online activity simple, fun, and profitable. So hundreds of people sign up. And find out that the service is really offering just rehashed information that is available online with a little research. They have no 'new' or 'secret' information, just a flashy way of presenting what is considered common knowledge. So a very very high percentage of these new 'members' decide the program is not for them (why do none of these services offer free trial periods or a sample lesson?) and try to cancel their membership. Only to find that the cancellation link is almost impossible to find, requires multiple steps, and may take 'up to six weeks' to complete! Many of these folks find they are still being billed 2, 3-, or 4 months after canceling... and cannot get anyone to answer the phone when the were finally able to dig out a Customer Service number. For every one legit training service, there are probably dozens that are really nothing more than "billing mills" -- they are looking only to generate that monthly billing, and to keep it going as long as possible. There may actually be content that they are delivering for the fee, but just because you can throw together a web page doesn't make you a web designer. Being able to rehash common information doesn't make you a trainer. Before signing up for ANYthing, people need to research the company offering the service. Check with their local BB - if you can't find a business address, that's also a major warning flag. Do a few Google searches and read past the first page -- it's fairly easy these days for companies to create enough web sites to fill up that first page... check a bit deeper and see if the tone of the comments changes. There's a reason most of the regulars on this board, and others, will warn new sellers away from "training services" -- and it's simply because there is so much information available free that there's really no need to pay for it. And think about this... one of the key abilities any seller, online or offline, needs is the ability to perform research. To check out new products, new suppliers, new markets, new venues, new anything. To dig below the surface and determine for themselves what's going to work and what's not worth the time. If you've been spoon-fed everything.... how you gonna learn to do all that research? When I drive into a gas station, I automatically check the price stated on the pump against the price stated on the sign. I check my receipt and watch the register when I shop retail, to make sure 'special offers' are showing up. And these are physical, brick-n-mortar businesses -- guess how much more I research the online businesses I buy from? <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/> Just my two cents -- things were different when I started selling on eBay, but that's hardly any reason to discount my experience over time. -Bob.

I haven't heard of them. Honestly, I don't think you need those guys to become a Powerseller. It's not at all hard to attain. You want to become a PS? Just go to your seller dashboard and it tells you what you need to know and what you need to do to become one. As for TRS...that's not hard to attain either. So, it's really all up to the individual of what they want to do and accomplish on eBay.

I cant speak from having any experience with Power Seller College myself. But from the massive amounts of research I have done Skip McGrath is the best at teaching you how to sell on eBay and other online marketplace's.

His credentials speaks for itself.
•eBay Power Seller since 1999
•Contributing editor to eBay Radio
•Only information seller allowed to exhibit at eBay Live
•Books are used in community college adult education classes
•Publish the oldest and largest newsletter for professional eBay sellers
•Invited to teach eBay consignment selling by eBay
•Author of seven books about eBay and web marketing

All the other big Guru types rave about him too

Check out his eBay user name: mcgrrrrr (has nothing to hide)
www.skipmcgrath.com

I dont see anyone else from powerseller college showing their real user id's.

In my humble opinion his coaching program is the best out there.
In my research on Powerseller College I found the scam sites and complaint sites to be filled with shills as well (Fake Testimonials)

"Success stories written in actual testimonials"? And you believe those are real, huh? Well heck it's on the internet, it MUST be true! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/shocked.gif" alt=":O"/>

Lol...I got a call from PSC today- I played along, knowing full well that I would turn around and research the hell outta them. I was "motivated, teachable, had the time," yadda, yadda, yadda. As soon as I asked where they were and heard they were in Utah...well, you know how that goes. Gimme a break!

I played along to the point where I almost had her giving ME money to join, and made an appointment to speak with her along with my husband on Monday at pm.....then went off to do my research. Holy shills, fake testimonial videos, blah, blah, blah.

Funny, there's not gonna be anyone home on Monday night to answer that call.....no way am I parting with my hard earned cash....I have Ebay resources, and think an "Ebay for Dummies" book somewhere that will teach me the same thing.......and the book only cost me about $20....what a scam!!!! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif" alt=":^O"/>

All you need to know about ebay, can be learned right on the ebay site, for free
And if you have questions, posters on all these boards are very quick (and nice!!) to help.

Everytime I hear people talk about these "learn ebay" programs they bought, it's a rip off plain and simple
And most will also try to sign you up with a dropshipping company.

The best way to learn ebay, is to do ebay...start small and learn the ins and outs...please don't give your hard earned money to these people! <img src="images/quote-right.gif"/>

I too received several calls from PSC. Had to jump through all these hoops to qualify.

I received the call from the director after the initial two calls that were asking me for my credit card limit and interest rate details. Very strange I thought at the time. Then I worked out why.

Also the first caller said he had to run my application past some other department before I can go ahead, which I passed of course. Hey, I'm in Australia. It was 11pm where he was. What department of this so called company would be open at that time? Anyway, I went along with it as I qualified to get a call from the director.

They have 3 training courses cheapest is $9,250 to $15,500. Big money for some magic software exclusive to them and the coaching deal.

All the phone calls were made on an IP phone through a pc. Perhaps skype or something. The voice quality was VERY poor. No way would a real business do that. They lost credibility right there and after hearing all the sales pitch and having to make a decision then and there, I KNEW it was B*llSh@t

Doing a real search through google is difficult because they have spent a lot of time creating bogus testimonials, blogs, scam reports, etc to promote themselves. Not much REAL information about them.

Beware!

I wish I would have taken the time to research before being smoothly talked into the purchase. First they were asking for $8,335.36; when that amount would not go on my credit card, it was miraculously dropped to $4,325.36 to make this all work. Yes, the transaction went through and now I am trying to have it rescinded pursuant to the 3-day policy that you can cancel within. I have sent several e-mails to finally be replied with "Charly has your file and will give you a call". Upon calling customer service I was put on hold for 20 minutes before it finally went to Charly's voicemail. This is a really bad way of doing business. They misrepresent themselves when they call and basically lie to you. When I figured out that the person I was talking to was not from New Life Profits (the website I originally signed up with) I asked how they got my phone number. I was told that New Life Profits sold the list to them. When I contacted New Life Profits and asked them about it, they indicated they don't sell their information; why would they? Then they would not have the business. You figure it out. I would suggest to stay away from this company!

I just finished speaking with an agent of this company...Here it is in a nutshell:

They want you to "invest" a minimum of $4,000 - $6,000 in your "business." As I was told, "This is going to teach me how to start an online business and give me the tools to make that business grow." The operative word in the company's title is college. This company is going to teach you about starting your own business and the "tricks of the trade" so to speak. There is no guarantee that you will make any money. You are paying a tuition cost to learn how to start up your own onine business.

My advice? Enroll in classes at a community college, or better yet, pay a very small fee (about $50) to enroll in an adult ed class sponsored by your local school district. You don't need to invest such a large amount of money with a company, with no guarantee of profit return. I'm sure they are a good "teaching" company, but you can get what they are offering at a much lower cost. They are not out to scam you, but they do want to charge you a hefty upfront fee to provide a teaching service.

My advise....

Find an ebay coach to work one on one with you that is already doing it and offering to teach..

I did this after 10 years of consignment. I am doing better 6 months of coaching than I did with 10 years of "trying to figure it out on my own".

Consignment made me good money, but learning to sell new, repeatable merchandise from a coach has by far outpaced everything I have done the last 10 years in only 6 months!

I have my nights and weekends back and now have the time to learn other off ebay ways to make money on the internet from other marketing coaches.

Even gave me time to start an off ebay local internet marketing company for other local businesses.

Now I have multiple streams of income all better than my consignment income.

And the best part is I am seeing how all the market research for each method works kinda together for the big marketing picture on the internet. It has actually amazed me at times!

And the funny thing, its all common sense. But till its pointed out....

And if all goes well and I keep learning, I hope to pass it forward and start coaching others in the future as well. Another stream of income!

Just wanted to share...

I got into coaching by accident, kind of. Had one of those "power seller college" type of places call me about 10 years ago. I could not afford that BIG $5K payment they wanted. They came up with a "deep discounted" program for me. Just 10 sessions.

I had a personal coach call me once a week and I learned to make a website &amp; list a product using their proprietary shopping cart software that would also allow the items to be listed on ebay with already filled out info from the website. I learned SEO and other stuff long those lines to promote the site. The coaching lasted maybe 10 sessions then ended.

Many years later I saw the fellow, Courtney, that coached me from that company had started his own online coaching business called the keyword academy. He was showing students that signed up for his membership style website how to research, set up and promote adsense PPC websites for profit. So I signed up and started learning SEO more in depth as a member of his site. He gives weekly webinars for live training and has a forum for members to compare notes and share ideas.

This led to me finding other internet style marketers to learn from....Which I now subscribe to 5 coaching programs of various marketing tactics.

The learning never ends. Finding others to learn from really does speed up the trial and error learning process. I am proof.

And as you learn to use each process, you figure out how to cross what you learn from one tactic to the others and you then see how it all can work together to really propel you forward in knowledge and earnings.

And its fun!!

You dont need a coach to learn to become a "power seller" per say. But to learn to research desirable markets in advance, and then how to source products for that market....Priceless!

And everything I learned I could have learned for free on the internet. You tube has everything. But a coach will eliminate the searching and sorting out all the correct info from the waste of time stuff and get you on track to success faster than doing it on your own.

Anyone else have a similar experience?

I've been 'paragraphing' since before I started selling on eBay -- online activities predate the Internet for many of us.

The 'blocking' that you saw was not my original post, but one that had gone thru at least one "translation"/"upgrade" of these discussion boards. Look closely enough at some of the older threads and you'll find many posts with what looks like two signature blocks! The first part of the original post... the second added during one of the many 'upgrades' that were not fully tested to catch such issues before the upgrade was rolled out to the production data.

These 'resurrection posts' are always interesting to read... and fun to use to see if you can detect when upgrades hit. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

Recently a Personal Friend of Mine, purchased a program "well" over $10,000.00 FROM A COMPANY CALLED,
"International Income Solutuions" - The main contact was a Mr. Mike Nell, "Google Him" You will find numerous complaints, and the fact that there are two websites, different addresses, and when the product was delivered, it was all video tutorials, based on "Power Sellers College" They, also have two names, The Other is " Powers Sellers Collegetech" OK ?? Over 10K, well?? The fact is, he was smooth to the groove, prommised the moon, they actually state a 100% 365 day return on investment. Also - "Personal, In Person, Via Telephone, complete Coaching and Personal Support. They set up times to call and guess what, no phone calls, then a set of requirments to go through the videos and training Modules. They clearly state ridgid refund policies. I inquired to see if the actual person that said he represented "Power Sellers College" was legitamate, I have yet to hear anything. To Future Sellers, ebay has all the info you need, never do business, with any "online company" That does not provide an actual address, actual phone number. Toll Free #'s are great for customer service, yet always look for a true business phone number. Both " International Income Solutions and Power Sellers College" provide neither. IIS, has two P.O. Box addresses. One in Utah, "Invalid" One in Boise Idaho. My friend was given an actual mailing address, and it proved to be a vacant apartment !! The Pricing is based on ?? What you can afford and how large you want your business - Major Red Flag !! NOW - TO E-BAY !!! As a user since 2001 with major purchasers, WHAT ?? !! "WAKE UP" as a Large Company, that is considered reputable, YOU have an ETHICS Responsibility, "YES YOU DO" No One and I mean "NO ONE" should be able to sell, market, use your logo's etc, for any type of training classes - NO ONE !! Yours is a Powerful Business !! Kudo's, I have had a blast with it, yet, GET REAL.
Take the next step, Certify and approve Independent E-Bay Training Programs. It's your Company, you have the right to do it and it is in the consumers best interest, it's called INTEGRITY. - Period. So, E-BAY, I am calling you on this, and I also hold "YOU" accountable. All Seller Programs, Power Seller Programs should be certified and Policed by ??? - YOU

When they brought up their five conditions of being 'accepted', I grew a little suspicious of PSC.

While my wife was on the phone with them, I googled PSC and found this forum. Sure glad I did. $7400 to have them coach us on how to use ebay?!?! You're kidding, right?

When I found out what they actually do, I told my wife that we weren't going to do it. He actually started getting hostile with me, so I hung up on him (wife was on the other phone). The buffoon at PSC told her that she was a grown woman and to do what she wanted, against her husband's wishes.

Got ripped off on shipping cost. How do I fix this?
</headline>
<post author="wolfgang2204" datetime="2012-02-26T12:56:00" id="p1">
Well, I listed some cabinets with 2 available and with calculated shipping. A buyer bought 2 but, was only charged for shipping for one.

They cannot be boxed together because of their sizes. A box large enough for 2 would have to ship by freight. Now I have to pay for the shipping on the second cabinet myself. Any way to fix this for next time so the buyer pays for shipping on both/all items?

Looks like I'm out about $30.00 on this transaction. Could have been much worse but, its just the next state over.

BTW, I do mix it up a little. Most of my items are free shipping but, just as an experiment I listed a few with calculated shipping. The ones with calcualted shipping are selling more it seems plus my DSR for shipping cost has stayed the same so far.

I see it. check one other listing that was fine, The only way that can happen is

buyer changed your shipping, not sure how but I know some know how to do that no matter what we do that you list the item as a single quantity then added more later without adjusting the shipping for the second piece. That's something you have to watch out for, it happen to me a while back when you do the listing at time it automatically say free shipping on the second, so double check that....I don;t know of anyway to do that other then going thru all the listing with multi quantity,1 by 1

But that's not too bad since you only have 28 listing.

Could be that the box that asks for "additional item cost" was auto set to "0". Might want to watch that box when you set your calculated shipping on a listing with more than 1 in qty.

coketag: I just checked my listings and there is no box for additional item cost.

I was looking through my site preferences and noticed that a box was checked that allows buyers to change the amount of the invoice. I don't ever remember checking that box.

The reason I went to site preferences is because I could have sworn there was an option available to require buyers to checkout once for each quantity. So, making the buyer checkout for each quantity. This would make life a lot easier as I can't combine shipping on large items. Right now I have to print a label for one box then create a label for each additional item. And as I found out today I can get ripped on the shipping for multiple quantities.

That IPR your looking for is in the listing form. It's a box to check in you payment options section of the form. Sadly, if they select more than 1, they will still be able to pay for all qty they selected, even though you've set it up for IPR.

<post author="clickitok" datetime="2012-02-16T10:52:00" id="p1">
I thought I was paying ebay to sell my products. When i noticed a HP ad trying to sell scanners on my scanner listings. No wonder i cant make any sells around here no more. Is this in there terms of service??? Does it state that we will be making money on the listings you pay ebay for. I dont think Imagine i payed google to advertise my site and they start advertising buy.com with my money I would be mad also cause my money was suppose to be spent on advertising my website. I was also looking at a sony refurbished laptop in the ebay sony store. And there it goes again another HP ad selling HP laptops.???? I bet sony does not know they are paying Ebay to sell Hp products. This is a huge conflict of interest. I Really dont understand why i am paying Ebay to run ads for other companies. Ebay makes a estimated 5.00 per 1000 views on there ads so my listing was shown 223 times at.005 x 223 Ebay has just made an extra 1.11 plus the.20 cents it cost me to sell. I feel since that ad would not be shown if i didnt pay for the listing We should get a Cut. Our money is driving there ads. We are also losing sells cause when someone clicks on the ad they are gone forever. At My expense. So instead on selling my product my money is being used to sell another compaines product. Without my knowledge. I really dont know what to think about this only reason i know the backend information is cause we own a bunch of websites and we do the same thing. we would never charge any of our users if we run ads on the site. Cause the revenue is in the ads.

My listings had a big scrolling bar of other sellers' items on ebay on my ads. What the F is that?? It says, "Look what other people are watching." If what my own items then that's awesome! But other seller's stuff when I'm dropping $400 a month in fees is BS. I've never noticed this before until you guys mentioned it in this thread. I'm guessing that is one of the reasons why my sales plummeted sometime ago and it's been hell ever since to try and get them back to normal.

After doing some research on this subject, you can't shut off other peoples listings from showing on your ad with a couple steps, however there is nothing we can do about the "sponsored results" box.

Goto "My Ebay"

Goto "Marking Tools" on the left hand side under the Seller Manager section.

Goto "Promote Similar Items" on the left hand side.

Once in there, click "no" and then update promotions.

Your items won't be seen on other seller's pagse, but it will atleast take other sellers items off of yours too. They started this nonsense on the 3rd of this month. I remember a lot of sellers were saying February has been a tough month for them. This may be one of the big reasons for that.

I've been having a tough time breaking 75k a year. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

I do realize that you sell for a large company. 75k a month seems like a lot to most of us but, its probably not so much for your company. Do you sell on a website and venues other than ebay as well?

75K a month for a large corporation isn't much as it's a BIG company.

I'm not even considered a small seller and I barely made 100K for 2011 so consider yourself lucky.

I wonder if there is a way to network with other ebay members who are selling for large companies on ebay?

Why not contact ebay and ask them to set up a board for major accounts?

Here is the issue about quotas. Ideally they should be set by you and your manager. If the employee has input, it often results in ownership, but very few bosses are willing to do that. They prefer top down management.

I took over a department in a major corporation. This department never met their quota without massive OT at the end of the month.
It turns out that the crew hated that mandatory OT. I fixed it by simply putting up a chart with a red line showing the quota and a blue line showing what we shipped. We cut out 90 percent of the OT and hit the quota at the end of the third week. Of course the boss raised the quota, but we always made it as a team.

Sorry....a little bragging there. Of course that was pulling stock for orders. We did not generate the orders, we were warehouse workers. Hopefully, you get my point that we took ownership of the quota.

So my suggestions are
one.....if you have not done so, take ownership, I am sure you have done so

two....network with people in similar situations, or find articles to read about selling for a major company on line What you are looking for is marketing ideas. Do you belong to any industry organizations?

three...buy promotional items from someone on Ebay who can imprint your logo on items. i can recommend someone LOL

Windchimeman1,

It is very difficult for me to take ownership of this quota. 75k/month was my quota last year. My total sales were $713664.73. I only hit my quota 4 times last year. They want me to increase eBay to 1 million in sales this year.

I guess I do need to take ownership of this. Its just hard because there is so much to do. I work a few hours each weekend answering emails and such. But it is really hard to get a good amount of work done at home. Blackthorne is a pain to sync on a bunch of machines.

We are in many industry organizations. I personally am not involved with these. Maybe I should look into that. =D

I have been trying to figure out what to put in the box to make the customers come back to me (rather than the companies website)

In reality meeting these goals set by my boss are hard because I do not get repeat customers. I am pretty much just marketing for the website by selling on eBay.

Once our customers learn about our website 90% of the time they buy from there rather than search us out on eBay.

Hi Ingeniouskha,

I guess I am lucky that I am in an industry that is able to pull that much from online sales. However the constant saying around here is that if were not beating last years sales then were not growing, and if were not growing, then why come to work?

If I was doing this by myself (like most eBay sellers) I would not be able to reach 75k / month. I have been trying to increase my traffic through various methods. It is working, I am now getting 1200-2000 views per day, but overall my sales have not increased dramatically.

I once turned down a job as a safety manager, because the owner of the company would not agree to put safety as part of the review of the manufacturing manager and transportation manager. Less accidents would help them get a raise. The owner was looking for someone who would be able to force safety down the throats of the managers.
I walked.

As a consultant i would tell your manager that your review should be in two parts
1. Ebay sales
2. How many customers you drive to the corporate web site
or what % of your customers buy later on the corporate site.
I am assuming that one of your bosses goals is to increase sales on the corp. site. usually that is more profitable than sales on Ebay due to the fees

Think about this. You are spending some of your time thinking about ways to NOT have the customers go to the corporate site. How counterproductive is that? What a waste of energy.

So I hate to tell you this, but you need to negotiate with your manager to change your job description and to be reviewed on the two points above. The question is how will it be measured? It can be done.

That is true. It is very counter productive to think about how to keep my customers on eBay. Well the problem is, is that since I started here, I have not been recording which customers are ones that originated from eBay and Amaz0n, and phone orders. So if we were to do something as such, I would have to start from this point recording which customers are mine.

After the customers original order is entered, the only way I can get credit for their future orders is if they contact me directly. Which means that I have to bend over backwards to make sure I do a good job, so they will remember me.

My very first thought on this was simple: How much credit do you get for repeat sales from customers who were initially eBay customers? How much credit is given for finding those folks who may not have found you otherwise, and who liked the service and the product enough to come back for more, and to make those additional purchases from what had better be a lower-cost commerce website rather than from eBay with their fees on fees on fees.

It's a pain to track - I know, I've developed in-house systems for multi-national corporations to match leads to future sales for commission hold-back purposes. If the corp generates the lead and hands it off to a distributor, the distributor gives back part of their commission since they did not FIND the lead, only develop it. After a stated period, commissions return to full level, as the distributor is crucial in retaining customers, and repeat orders are the sign that they are doing that.

If you are actively promoting website sales in your eBay shipments, with inserts, coupons, discounts, and whatever -- then your tracking just got easier. Get the company to create a real customer account for each eBay buyer, and then inform that buyer that they can use that account at your website to make future purchases, be they thru the website or via an 800# or mail-order catalog or whatever other venues the company sells in. Get those accounts clearly marked as eBay accounts and tracking is more accurate and much easier.

Good Luck!!

and it says that the item must be returned within 7 days and that the buyer must pay return shipping.

Are the funds being withheld during the case? If they are I would contact eBay for your question, if they are not, I would let things ride as they are.

HAD ENOUGH OF PUNITIVE EBAY POLICIES
</headline>
<post author="woodys-pickups-and.." datetime="2012-02-24T10:32:00" id="p1">
Ok... I've had enough. I'm done. I, partnered with my brother, have a very successful Ebay business under another account and I wanted to spin off part of it and start a new account. I rapidly found out that I was stuck to selling only 100 items (either 100 of a single item or 1 of 100 individual items... either way, a TOTAL of only 100 items) a month. I sell guitar pickup parts. Small magnets, plastic covers, screws, etc. That means I could only sell 100 screws a month or 100 small magnets a month but not more than a TOTAL of 100 things. I was told that, after 90 days, I could request an increase. I waited 120 days and then requested an increase. Because I didn't list/sell anything for the past month (it simply wasn't profitable to only sell 100 screws a month... hard to pay the house payment doing that!), I had to relist 100 items and wait until I had a "current" track record. Now, partnered with my brother, we do thousands of dollars a month in business and have been a member of Ebay for 13 years but that wasn't good enough. This is simply NOT a good place to start an online business. If you're clearing out your garage... maybe. If you want to get rid of a dozen things you bought in a garage sale... maybe. But not if you're trying to start something serious that will, eventually, produce anything close to a liveable income for you. And talking to anyone at Ebay (Allen) is like talking to a wall. When they are reading a response from The Ebay Account Holder Denial Phone Operator's Manual, common sense clearly does not exist there. For that reason, we are off to Amazon! Closed the Ebay account and we're gone...

Did you ask eBay -before- you started selling how you could get around the new-seller limits, since you were not a "new" seller but a seller wishing to open a "new", secondary account? Many of us have done this and gotten the restrictions lifted on the second, or whatever, account rather quickly. Like while we're on the phone.

eBay isn't the 'free-for-all' it used to be, but then, neither is the Internet on which it operates. Users are smarter, shoppers are smarter, and so are the crooks. Things just aren't the way they used to be.

While it's always easier to 'sail before the wind' (letting the wind at your back push you along), if sailors hadn't figured out how to sail into the wind (by tacking left and right in a zip-zag motion), they'd have been hard pressed to return home after leaving port!

But... if you're happier elsewhere, then good for you. And good for those who sell the same and have remained behind... for they now have one less competitor. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

Bob, yes I spent an hour on the phone with them last December and another hour on the phone with "Allen" just yesterday but talking with an Ebay rep is like talking to a wall. There seems to be a stock answer for everything. That's been my experience with this account and with the other account that we currently operate. They seem to espouse a "one-size-fits-all" approach and that is one of the reasons that a LOT of the businesses on Ebay have simply closed their accounts. Ebay seems to be very pro-buyer and very anti-seller.

As far as the whole "crooks" thing is concerned... you're right. There are a LOT of scammers out there these days trying to get something for nothing. We already operate an Ebay business (in a related field) with almost 5,000 feedbacks. While I thought that would certainly mean something to them, it actually meant nothing whatsoever. "Allen" was trying to tell me that, in order for them to lift the 100 item restriction, I "needed to get a little more experience on Ebay". I told him that I and another person already own and operate an Ebay business (12 years on Ebay) and that I had a LOT of experience but it was as if he was reading from an operational manual and not really listening at all. In my first phone call, I was told that I should "tie the new, related endeavor to the existing Ebay business" so I could get that restriction lifted faster. I thought I did that back in December. "Allen" just told me the same thing yesterday but doing that apparently meant nothing at all. They were still going to enforce the 100 item limit... a limit that restricts selling on Ebay to that of a hobby and not a business.

Bob, thanks for your note!

In our experience, when you call Ebay with a problem, all that they provide is their explanation of why they did what they did. You should NEVER call them with the expectation that something will change. They never change what they did whether it was fair to you or not. They only explain what they did. On more than one occasion, we've even had Ebay reps tell us that what they did wasn't fair to us but they weren't going to change the outcome. Cookie-cutter service. If we treated our customers like that, we wouldn't have any customers!

What needs to happen to institute any change is that a large group of powersellers needs to get together and threaten to bail on them. Bet they'd listen THEN.

Ebay requires A LOT of work and learning in order to become a profitable seller.... Don't necessary agree with your #1.

Depending on what you sell - some items are better to sell at yard sales compared to ebay.... Example: Large, bulky, heavy items.....

I agree with you that ebay has the potential to be ran all year long as long as you're making money and paying your bills..... Don't forget about DSRs, they can make you or break your ebay selling venture.

If it's fun and easy now wait until you really deal with the many issues that you come across here... Whether dealing with problematic buyers, ebay policies, returns, SNADS, INRs, etc.....

I think the number one reason for me is that I unique items on ebay have a nationwide market that you just can't get at a garage sale.

For example, if I list a vintage stitchery kit on ebay, I can make a decent amount and some may make quite a bit. At a yard sale -- may not sell at all (likely), or for just a tiny amount.

Yeah... I don't agree with your number 1 either.

On ebay, it's not all fun and games. I'm a new seller and I've had to give out atleast 7 refunds in the past 6 months... because either the item arrived damged, item didn't work (but I tested before listing, buyer threatened with negative)... I've had 2 feedback revisions from buyers... One item I sold was lost by USPS... had to call them atleast 5 times in order for them to do something about it... I received a Neutral because of that... but USPS finally did find the package and got it back to me... then once in a while you encounter the scammer here on ebay who tries to get free stuff...

Ebay is a real business if you sell like you mean it.... you have to have A LOT of patience, devotion, and customer service skills, because if you don't your business will go down the drain...

trade paperback is a large size paperback, not the mass market paperback size (and not the tall skinny ones that some bestsellers have come in). About 6x9, I think. These are often produced by smaller presses, some of which specialize in the mystery market.

I usually get bidders on all these books because most of them have been released in the last few months or some of the trade paperbacks are hard to find at decent prices (I sometimes have a search going for months to find a copy below the retail price). I have several regular customers who bid on these items, so that makes it nice! Then I can combine shipping (I use the standard $4, but that is highly reduced for combined media mail).

All of this comes about because I am an avid reader. I just try to break even on the books I buy to read. And I actually make a little on some, lose a little on others.

Thanks for asking!

Sorry Chan... you're a bit off on this.

Personally, I think there are parts of eBay that ARE a yard sale! And parts are a flea market. And a few areas are just in disrepair.

But the comments made got me thinking... if sellers are constantly trying to undercut others, then aren't we the ones creating the "yard sale" environment? If we cheapen ourselves to attract buyers who are only looking for price and nothing else, then how can we complain when the buyers we attract only want cheap?

My pennies aren't cheap -- I make a profit on each, and that's after covering all my costs AND allowing for the making of a replacement coin. I seldom buy coins sight-unseen because I only want to sell the best, and when you buy in bulk, you can't always be sure of what you get.

I did buy some bulk lots a couple years back. Nearly 1000 coins, as I recall, from multiple buyers over about a month's time span. Never got feedback from a single one <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/sad.gif" alt=":("/> And the coins I got were mostly junk -- stuff you'd find a the bottom of a greasy, grimey, seldom sees the light of day junk can. My grandfather's both had one in their shops -- when they'd pull equipment apart that they weren't trying to fix, the nuts, bolts, cotter pins, etc would all go in a 'junk can'. Once in a while they'd sort thru to pull the best and toss the rest... to someone else, usually. Farm folks really seem to know how to recycle! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/>

So sorry... but I think you're off base here. And before y'all start blasting a poster about being "your kind", you might want to check their feedback... feedback left as a buyer, in this case. If there's little, or it's trashy, then maybe you have a point. I haven't looked... have any of you?

Ment to help............

This is why it's important to look at your DSR's frequently. It's not just hidden buyer complaint's, but actual useful information that one can learn from to improve upon their services to their buyers.

You said earlier that you have 6-7 returns for damaged shipments. 1 can be dismissed as: OK USPS messed up, but after the 2nd or maybe the 3rd, that tells a different story. I personally would have ceased shipping in that manor, and seriously looked into packing my items differently to avoid future shipping damage.

Please take a moment to look over your DSR's and see if you can find, change and apply something new to each of the 4 categories, in order to bring those numbers up. It's not to late, but it will take time to recover.

Alot of sellers won't take the time to analize the important information DSR's provide. Even though they are only buyer opinions, a lot can be learned from them.

I have no idea of how many listing I put out but As of now I am guessing it will result in around 25 sales or so,But it did bring to total sale number back up for the week to somewhat normal.Considering the changing season and everything else, it was ok.

HOLDING PAYPAL FUNDS TO AND FROM BUYERS
</headline>
<post author="lady-b-etc" datetime="2012-02-13T09:50:00" id="p1">
THIS PROCESS IS UNJUST. I HAVE BEEN WITH EBAY FOR OVER 12 YEARS AND HAVE A POSITIVE RATING OVER 3800. BECAUSE THREE PEOPLE OUT THERE PUT ON THEIR LITTLE QUESTIONAIRE THAT THEY DIDN'T LIKE MY 2.00 HANDLING FEE, I NOW AM HAVING MY MONEY FROM PAYPAL WITHHELD FOR 21 DAYS. I RECENTLY FELL AND BROKE MY HIP. WHILE I WAS IN HOSPITAL AND FOUR WEEKS IN A NURSING HOME, 22 AUCTIONS ENDED. MY HUSBAND DID A GOOD JOB PACKING AND SHIPPING, TILL HE GOT TO THE POST OFFICE AND FOUND WE COULD NOT ACCESS THE OVER 400 DOLLARS THAT WAS IN PAYPAL. WE ARE RETIRED AND LIVE MONTH TO MONTH ON SOCIAL SECURITY. WE HAD TO USE OUR GROCERY AND GAS MONEY TO PAY THE SHIPPING CHARGES. SO MY HUSBAND COULDN.T COME VISIT ME IN THE NURSING HOME, CAUSE WE HAD NO MONEY FOR GAS.
ALSO, ALL THE ITEMS WE SHIPPED ARE NOT YET PAID FOR, SO WE SHIPPED A LOT OF VERY EXPENSIVE ITEMS, SOME TO EUROPE, EVEN THOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR MONEY FOR 21 DAYS.

IF EBAY IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO RESTRICT THEIR SELLERS WITH UNJUST RULES THEY ARE GOING TO LOSE A LOT OF SELLERS. WITHOUT SELLERS YOU CANNOT HAVE BUYERS. A TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESSFUL SELLING FOR 12 YEARS SHOULD BE ENOUGH OF A REFERENCE ABOUT ME AS A SELLER. IF I CAN'T SHIP WITHIN THE THREE DAYS I LIST AS SHIP TIME, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THINK THEY ARE BEING RIPPED OFF. THEN A LOT OF NEGATIVE FEEDBACK WILL HAPPEN, AND DESTROY THE GOOD REPUTATION I HAVE BUILT UP OVER 12 YEARS. I HAVE SEVERAL FRIENDS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS.

PERHAPS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TELL THE BUYERS THAT EBAY AND PAYPAL ARE HOLDING THEIR FUNDS, KEEPING THEM FROM THE SELLERS FOR 21 DAYS, AND THEREFORE WE CANNOT SEND THEIR PACKAGES FOR THAT AMOUNT OF TIME. I DOUBT IF THAT WILL MAKE A BUYER HAPPY, IT WILL LEAD TO A SERIOUS DISSATIFACTION AND LEAD TO LOTS OF NEGATIVE FEED. OTHERWISE, I HAVE TO FIND THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THE SHIPPING, AND SEND ITEMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN PAID FOR, STICKING MY NECK OUT A MILE. TRUSTING AND HOPING THAT I WILL EVENTURALLY GET THE FUNDS. SCARY, I SAY...

PLEASE JOIN ME IN PROTESTING THIS PRACTICE. EBAY AND PAYPAL THINK IT WILL PRODUCE BETTER SELLERS IN THE LONG RUN, BUT A WHOLE PILE OF THINGS CAN GO WRONG IN THOSE RESTRICTIVE TIME PERIODS AND IT WILL SURELY COST THEM A LOT OF EMPLOYEE TIME WHEN THEY HAVE TO LISTEN TO EXTENDED CALLS WITH COMPLAINTS FROM THE BUYERS AND SELLERS. THIS IS AN UNJUST PRACTICE, AND SHOULD BE RESOLVED. APPLIED ONLY TO SELLERS WHO HAVE A 'SEVERE' NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS. JUST A PERIOD OF INACTIVE SELLING ITEMS SHOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TO WITHOLD FUNDS FROM THE SELLERS EITHER. WE CANNOT ALL BE FULL TIME SELLERS, WE ARE 70 YEARS OLD AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET THROUGH THE MONTH.
AGAIN, PLEASE JOIN ME IN TELLING EBAY AND PAYPAL THEY NEED TO CHANGE THEIR VERY SEVERE RESTRICTIONS. LADY-B-ETC

Buyer bought...paid...shipped....key in DC to Paypal and eBay....received...Paypal releases funds. It doesn't take 21 days...it COULD TAKE UP TO 21 days but my understanding is that Paypal releases the funds once it shows delivered.

This is nothing new.

Please turn off all caps when posting, it's really hard to read when your yelling like that.

Your buyers have been speaking to you through that Shipping Cost DSR. Unfortunatly, you weren't listening. 21 day holds will be nothing if that SC DSR drops any further.

I've never add a handling fee to any item. Infact, I offer my international buyers a 20% discount for the postage they are charged via calculated shipping. I learned from my first and only low DSR that charging for shipping, even when I did 1.oo max ship cost, to only list items with free shipping. Never had a single problem since then.

The data is there for you to adjust your shipping. You can act on it, or just continue to let the ship run its' course.

You didn't have to use your gas money for shipping cost. Paypal releases neccessary funds to purchase labels online. And if you purchase labels online the Delivery Confirmation number automatically uploads to ebay. Plus you get a discount for online label purchasing. Once item is delivered than the rest of your funds are released.

Stop charging a handling fee. Your just asking for trouble there. Instead add a bit to your overall item price.

INSURANCE IS SUGGESTED, ESPECIALLY ON BREAKABLES OR HIGH COST ITEMS. IF YOU DO NOT REQUEST INSURANCE BE ADDED TO YOUR SHIP COST, I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE WHICH MAY OCCUR BETWEEN THE POST OFFICE AND YOUR DOOR.

I hope you know that this is against eBay's policy...just saying. It's the seller's responsibility to get the item to the buyer as advertised otherwise you'll get hit with a whole bunch of SNAD's.

Hi - I think if you read the replies to your post, you will find some good suggestions that will make selling on eBay a little bit easier. Just like other aspects of life, there are rules you may not think are fair and just but if you still have to follow them.

I know you're frustrated but take control over what you CAN control to avoid low DSR's and bad feedback. Best of luck to you.

Add free shipping to all your listings. Include the cost of shipping &amp; a small handeling fee into your list price. In the end, it comes out to be the same cost for the buyer, also, if you print your labels, through e-bay, your postage is discounted, delivery confirmation tracking information is automatically uploaded for you and an e-mail is sent to your buyer with the tracking number. It's much easier &amp; less expensive than running to the post office.
3 days after your package is confirmed delivered, your funds are automatically released from Paypal, not 21 days.
You also get an automatic high DSR star rating by offering free shipping. No more dings for high shipping costs.
p.s. the money you save on postage &amp; gas by printing your labels through e-bay you won't have to charge a handeling fee.

Forgot to add, when printing your e-bay labels, after you put in the package weight &amp; size and hit the calculate button, on the right side of the page the cost of the shipping comes up, check the box "pay later", Paypal will "float" the $ to pay for shipping, when the item is delivered and your funds clear, they automatically deduct the shipping cost they "floated" from your funds.
Also, it's the sellers responsibility to get the package to the buyer undamaged. I include insurance on all breakables. If the buyer receives the item damaged without insurance, the seller is responsible. The seller will have a damaged item returned and paypal will refund the buyer their $.
The seller will have a damaged item and no $

Hello, They pulled that with us after starting to sell again after a lull in sales! 2 calls and they found a way to resolve this issue with us. These calls were on the aggressive side with a little threat of stopping the use of their service. With in a 3 days they cleared our account with no further problems! I do believe the squeaky wheel does get the grease!
We need the funds to continue to purchase and resell. If they do it again that will be the end for us.

I can sympathize with you. I have had my funds with held now for over a month. I'm retired and been with ebay since 1998. I think it is theft on ebays part. The only real reason is to collect everyone's interest. I have a few listings on right now but I think I may be done with them. Ebay and Paypal are one in the same and they have no problem stealing your interest. I have very good rating with over 7000 feedbacks and most are good but you can't please everyone. I'm at 99.5 at present and I'm usually at 100 percent. I'm now considered below standard!! In my area I watch 20 or 30 sellers and right now only 2 are selling anything. We can only hope someone hires a lawyer. I would like to see ebay settle a class action suit for millions.It would serve them right. I'm fed up with all of their crooked tactics.

Your looking for the "variation listing" style. That is only availiable in certain categories. Maybe (without violating the listing in the wrong category policy) you can find an alternate category (appropriate) for your item that has this listing option.

Understanding, "One is just the middleman for the collection &amp; forwarding of all fees &amp; postage", is the first step to avoid paying them out of pocket.

Got a great deal!

<post author="broadwayguy99" datetime="2012-02-21T17:02:00" id="p1">
LOL - Just bought an Iphone dock/charger/stand from our friends in China for guess how much?

$2.43 SHIPPED!

It seems that with cell phone accessories the Chinese dominate the market.... They are selling sooooo cheaply with decent quality.

Recently bought another Iphone Stand (okay quality) for $3.63 SHIPPED.... Arrived in less than 10 days.... Figured if not good I only wasted a few bucks... This item serves the purpose BUT is a little flimsy when phone sits on stand (constantly tipping over)... The item I just bought is of better quality too! Can't wait!!!

Seems like shipping has been pretty quick coming from China these days...

I love when I find a great deal! Thanks to the Chinese sellers!

Dunno if it's a great deal since I wasn't paying attention with the GBP vs Dollar thingie....well, bought something and in the end what I though as $79.99 including shipping turned out to be $123 and some change.

My finds go back a few months and from USA sellers..

Sniped 3 auctions here for total 9.05 + 15.oo shipping. Relisted and sold each for 5o.oo+.

And as I posted in another thread. I bought 2 copies of Adobe CS3 master collection on another site for.99cent each + 5.oo each shipping. Used one to created my store header, and sold the other copy here for 99.99.

I'm not sure what Adobe CS3 is but sounds like a great deal to me!!!! I have bought some items from China here and gotten very good deals and been happy but since my new day job is a manufacturer of an auto part..my head keeps saying please buy American...but my budget argues

This is why I've recommended designers for sellers 'on the grow'... and why I've always been a bit jealous of Ms Milo's talent. It's not that I couldn't replicate something she's created.... it's that she's created it and I can only replicate.
