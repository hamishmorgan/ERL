I went to Hebron yesterday and I was quite tired physically and mentally. Hebron is a town where the most aggressive settlers live. Palestinians are almost gone because of the settlers’ horrible violence.

The day before the tour, there was a shooting in Jerusalem. 6 Jews were killed by the shooting and 2 Arabs were killed by the police. During the tour, a man came to the organizer and started shouting at him a few inches away from him. The man shouted a hundred times, “He is helping the last night’s killer!” The organizer ignored the man but it was painful to watch. The organizer used to be a soldier in Hebron. Now, he started this tour and brings tourists to Hebron and say, “This is what is happening here.”

During the tour, some soldiers were looking at us and following us about 20 meters away. They knew who the organizer was and what kind of tourists we were. One of the soldiers were holding a gun and aiming at us. Nobody reacted because the organizer told us not to react and to just ignore. But it was the first time for me to be pointed at by a gun, and it was scary even though it was 20m away. I felt like Israeli soldiers can do anything they want. It wouldn’t happen in other countries. What kind of soldiers would point their guns at 'tourists'?

Anyway, what makes me sad is this. I am staying in Israel with Jewish people. People who don't think they have prejudice or any kind of discrimination started to 'protect Palestinians' after I told them that I am in Israel with Jewish people. That is what I am tired of.

This is the reality of the people in Neve Shalom -Wahat as-Salam. From other Jewish people, they are treated like traitors. With Palestinians, they have a difficult time dealing with the guilty conscience because they have nice houses and good jobs.

It is not easy to just live in this land. I have been here for 6weeks, but I got many kinds protest from 'outside', usually from the Japanese who never visited here. The things are so complicated and it is not only Israeli/Palestinian issue.

Yesterday, Daria and Henry and another volunteer went on the tour with me. It was just a day after the shooting and people were tense. It is very dangerous for Jewish people to go on this tour even without major incidents like this shooting. But I insisted to go on the tour, because I wanted to see the settlement myself. Daria and Henry also wanted to go, but they knew how dangerous it was for them. It is OK for a tourist like me, but it is not OK for Jewish people to get into West Bank, especially the day after a serious incident. But the tour is welcomed by Palestinians. Palestinians know what kind of tour this is. The organizer was always welcomed by kids and residents.

Palestinian situation is terrible but they cannot change the condition by themselves because of the laws that forbid every kind of human rights. If they break the law, they will get arrested immediately. What we can do is to encourage Israeli activists, spread information to the Jewish communities and to awaken them. They have the power to change. That is what NS-WAS and other Jewish activists are trying to do. On the other hand, Japanese NGOs are trying to help Palestinians develop skills to earn money.

It is not easy to explain, but I hope you will understand.

H. sent me his article.
It is about the trip we went to yesterday.

His origin is British, but moved in USA with his family, then came here from VA. He told me he felt like he was a minority all the time in his life.

The Hebron Trip

The TV news brought the story of one Pinchads Zlotosvsky, a former neo-nazi thug, living in Poland. One day his mother revealed to him his Jewish origins. He shifted gears and became an ultra-orthodox Jew. I thought of this story when we visited Hebron yesterday. Our tour was led by Yehuda Shaul, a former IDF sergeant who served in Hebron, who now leads groups of Israelis and foreigners on informative tours of the city. On the bus he described an evening when, as a soldier, he and his unit went joyriding in the city, shooting at street lights and the windshields of cars. He told how sometimes, in the early morning hours they would begin firing into the city, not in response to Palestinian fire, but in order to deter the Palestinians from shooting, in case they would start.

Our tour of Hebron took in some of the same streets that Shaul used to patrol as a soldier - just like those we saw in the city. They are from the same Nahal Brigade 50th Battalian in which he served. "This is probably the most leftist unit in the army", he chuckles. "That leftists came to do the things we are talking about may be the best proof that there is no good way of doing what we are doing." Breaking the Silence, one of the two organizational "hats" worn by Shaul on this trip (above his yarmulka) does not adopt a political line, but wishes to bring home to Israelis the direct consequences of the occupation, so that civil society can make its own decisions.

The soldiers who serve there are young. It is usually their first time in Palestinian cities, and many of them don't know why they are serving there. Shaul describes how, at the beginning of his service, he attended a welcoming talk for the army by settler leaders. When the speaker praised the IDF for sending its best soldiers to safeguard the city's Jewish heritage, many of the soldiers walked out in disgust.

The soldiers have very little in common with the settlers they are sent to protect, but what they do share with them is the alienness of their presence in Hebron. The settlers, who number between 800 and a 1,000 amongst a population of 166,000 Palestinians, seem only able to live there because, in place of this current reality, they see an image of the city's distant past, and a future when the city will be Jewish again. This is well illustrated by the sequence of four murals that now adorns the closed bus station on Shuhada Street. The first of the murals shows the Biblical city, the mythical world of Abraham. The second shows the return of the Jews to Hebron, a few hundred years ago. The third shows the destruction of the Jewish community in 1929. The fourth shows the future of the city, with settlers and soldiers and the Messiah entering on his white donkey. There are no Palestinians in this final, idyllic picture. But even today the centre of the city is largely off limits to them.

A few minutes after seeing these murals drawn by the settlers, we were in the home of a Palestinian who lives under the shadow of the Tel Rumeida settlement. There, on his living room wall was another idyllic picture, of a future peace. A tropical paradise - sun, sand, palm trees, distant islands, and Palestinians on the beach. Some of these are wounded and bleeding. Why? "It has two images", explained our host - "the present, where people are suffering - and the future, when there will be peace."

This vision of an imagined peace appears to have little to do with Hebron or Palestine. Hasham's house lies directly beneath the Tel Rumeida settlement and his yard is littered by garbage which he claims is tossed down from above. Among the smaller items is the front page of a settler newspaper, which testifies to its source. Among the larger items is an old washing machine, which Hasham says was aimed at his head. Despite acts of daily humiliation and occasional settler violence, Hasham is happy to meet with Israeli peace activists, tell his story and share his perhaps unrealistic vision of peace. He views these meetings as a political act, an act of nonviolent resistance.

After leaving Hasham's house, we stood on the main access road to the Tel Rumeida settlement - an ugly mass of linked caravans on an ancient archeological site of the city, perhaps from the Bronze age. While our guide was trying to answer whether the site was historically Jewish, a settler woman came down, passing the soldiers who stood between us and the settlement. With a baby in her arms and another two children in tow, she had come to express her anger that this day especially, after eight yeshiva students had just been shot in Jerusalem, we had chosen to come to show support for Palestinians. She had a bellyfull of grievances to declaim, although few of the group, unfortunately, understood Hebrew. Those who did, including my wife, began to argue, which I think is unfortunate because of all the people we had seen today, I thought this woman was the most interesting. I felt I understood the Palestinians. Their story is evident and hardly needs a commentary. I understood Shaul and his change of heart, after serving in Hebron, and through him I understood the behaviour of the police and soldiers we had seen. But this woman, who had chosen to raise her children as a feared and hated minority among 166,000 of her enemies, was finally interesting. Even, or especially, for a person like me who has chosen to live among Palestinians and Jews as friends.

The mind and motivation of the settlers of Hebron probably cannot be understood without entering into their world, but I think we can reach some sort of approximate understanding from our own human experience. These people are on a kind of trip.

Our own trip to Hebron that day had been surreal and hallucinogenic: passing through tunnels that burrowed under Palestinian towns, traveling along apartheid roads protected by concrete barriers and then on into a city centre become ghost town, its shops barred from the front and occupied from the rear by settlers. In this landscape, we were an alien presence, looked upon with scorn from the settlers, viewed with incredulity by most Palestinians, and regarded as a potentially troublesome bunch of leftist crackpots by the police and soldiers. The Jews who had chosen to live in Hebron are similarly alien but have decided to put down roots. Nobody minds being a stranger for a day, but to make a life of it requires courage, determination and the zeal of a zealot.

Settlers will tell you that their activities are just a natural extension of Zionism. (Their enemies probably agree with them.) America had its westward drive, Europeans had their empires. In Israel, the frontier is the 1949 armistice line, with the lands beyond it providing room for greedy expansion. The radical fringe of the settler movement establish outposts on remote hilltops or carve out ghettos in Palestinian cities like Hebron.

Settlement in hostile territory, the return to religion, political activism, and the bored violence of soldiers are all ways in which individuals seek to fill their lives with excitement or meaning. The neo-Nazi thug mentioned at the beginning of this article became the ultra-orthodox Jew of today. The Nahal soldier who served in Hebron yesterday is now a political activist educating about the evils of the occupation. The settlers, all of whom knew him well, taunt him constantly, "Hey Yehuda, tell 'em what you did to the Arabs when you were here..." The Bronx accents of these settlers reveal their city kid origins and their own journey of personal fulfillment. Guarded by the army, but still vulnerable, these settlers present an easy target for other Hebronites to escape their own inertia by joining the liberation struggle.

The Holy Land is the Hollywood set where bored actors seeking adventure can play out their wild fantasies, many of which are highly dangerous to the ordinary people, Jews and Palestinians, who just want to live out their lives, raise children, and enjoy their grand children, while maintaining a modicum of personal dignity.

It might not be so bad if only individuals were involved, and these individuals were not empowered and protected by powerful political or economic interests, but the Middle East is one of the few places in the world where radicals can determine the destiny of nations. The settler woman who came out to greet us in Hebron deserves respect. She has proportionately more power in Israeli society than untold numbers of mild leftists. As Shaul said, "the presence of the settlers in Hebron is a political act with which we cannot compete."

When Baruch Goldstein, a resident of Kiryat Arba, the large settlement that adjoins Hebron, went into the Cave of the Patriarchs and killed 29 Muslims at prayer, Rabin had the best possible opportunity to evacuate the settlers from Hebron, but found himself powerless. The following year he was gunned down by a rightwing radical who said he was inspired by Goldstein's act.

Henry told me an interesting story.

He went to Arabic lesson this morning. The teacher is a Palestinian who lives in this village. Arabic teacher gave him some food made by grasses around here. It was so nice and tasty. Usually, we don't know much about grasses or trees around us, even their names. But natives like this Arabic teacher knew how to use it and what kind of nutrition we can get from the grasses.

He said that giving name is a very important thing because it is a kind of start to know what it is or who s/he is. I think it is true. Our interest usually starts from memorizing the name of some ‘thing’ or a ‘person’

…İ also want you to know the Jewish people’s effort of peace making. What they are doing is not very easy. They face double discrimination, from other Jewish people because they are considered as 'traitors’ and another from the outside world because they are 'Israelis.' They are trying to make peace, but no one but their friends can understand.

Palestinian situation is more difficult but you probably knew that sometimes people from Arab countries discriminate against Asians. Because of this, it was difficult to get along with the Palestinians the first time. Finally, İ managed to get along with them, but it was a bit difficult in the beginning.

Now, I am in Istanbul! İ can tell you a story about me overcoming my weakness. (İ am a bit sorry for the people now, but feel really good)

İ was at the Ataturk airport again, a catch salesman for a shuttle bus came to me. First time I refused, but I couldn’t find a way to get to the hotel, so İ decided to take the shuttle. It sounded too expensive as what I was told was 30 by taxi, but shuttle is 50. But he said it was cheaper than taking a taxi. “5minutes wait at the Starbucks around the corner, İ will call you.” I waited for 30 min. but nobody come. İ feel pretty bad because again, they used me because İ am a woman, alone, an Asian, and did not look so strong and looked stupid. İ decided to go to the counter, gathering my courage and shouted at them, “You said 5 minutes waiting, but I’ve been waiting for 30min! İ want my money back right now!”

after that, whole story has changed. İ will tell u later.

(blog diary)

This is my fist time visiting Turkey. I spent 2 nights and 3 days in Istanbul, just walking around the hotel where I stayed and seeing Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Grand Bazaar and the Underground Cistern etc.

In this tourist area, people are very open-minded, probably to catch their customers. Perhaps, a Japanese woman who is walking alone in this area is one of the best targets for them, and I got caught several times.

I walked down to the beach this morning which is 5 minutes from here. A Turkish man who runs a small cafe offered me a cup of tea. We exchanged some usual conversations about our family, country and religion for almost 10 minutes. We had a nice time in front of the beach and I asked how much the tea cost, but he didn't accept because, he said, the shop wasn't open yet.

I am confused now.
People are very nice and open here, but totally materialistic. After the 6 weeks of visiting Israel/Palestine, it is very hard to accept the reality and the atmosphere of the capitalistic world. Conflict zone is now familiar to me and this sounds like Esther in "The Zahir."

I’m leaving Istanbul today. Only two days’ stay in Istanbul gave me a lot of energy and healing power. İ also learned about myself from this trip.

Anyway, Turkish people are very open, but economy doesn’t seem to be as good as it used to be.

İ am happy to be seeing mom at the airport. Thanks for telling me.

I will start to write something after go back to Japan.

March 14, 2008
(email from Turkey)

İ am leaving here in a couple of hours. This is one of the most beautiful places to visit. People are so open and some of them are trying to catch customers very hard. It is very difficult to protect myself from the salesmen everywhere around. İ almost bought a Turkish carpet for 1000 dollars.

But it makes me sad and makes it difficult for me to accept this kind of openness after visiting Palestine. People are sill dying but here, they are just talking about money and love, the same as other countries.

Turkey is Westernized, but some people are very religious (not many in Istanbul...)

İ am quite tired right now, so I would be happy to go back and rest in my bed.

I got back from Israel on March 15. The days in Israel seem like a dream after I've been back in Japan. However, this calmness shows me the differences of the situation in Japan and in the Middle East, so it makes me much sadder.

During the Hebron Tour, a man came from Australia said, “Palestinians just want to live an ordinary life. They don't ask anything special. Why, then?”

Usually, we don't think about Palestinians in our daily life although the invasion and the occupation are still going on there. It has been 60years since Israel established their country and that means almost an entire generation has passed.

I was stunned to find out that there are many Kurdish people in Turkey, but they are not allowed to speak their language outside. The Kurds have the third largest population after the Arabs and the Turks. Unfortunately, before they tried to be independent, people discovered oil and water in Kurdistan. The independence plan has changed. Since then, Kurdish people have not been able to have their own country (from Pelletiere, Stephen C., The Kurds: An Unstable Element in the Gulf. 1984, Westview Press: Boulder)

I think it would be better to go back to the beginning. Every land belongs to God, not to a certain ethnic group or people.

I see the same sadness in the eyes of Palestinians and Kurdish people.

My trip ended with this inexplicable feeling.

ISLAMABAD: Opposition politician and former cricketer Imran Khan said Saturday that President Pervez Musharraf has committed treason and should face the death penalty for declaring a state of emergency.

Imran Khan also called on the Pakistani people to resist Musharraf's move and not to recognise the new chief justice appointed by the military ruler.

&amp;quot;He has committed high treason by negating the orders of the Supreme Court which bars him from taking any unconstitutional steps and by sending in troops after the Supreme Court decision,&amp;quot; Khan was quoted as saying.

&amp;quot;He is punishable by death.&amp;quot;

He continued to say, &amp;quot;I urge every Pakistani people not to recognise this collaborator chief justice.

&amp;quot;I urge the people, lawyers, civil society to resist this move by Musharraf. I urge lawyers to boycott the court proceedings.&amp;quot;

Pledge of Commitment:

International Conference on Justice for Palestine, Hotel Toledo, Amman, Jordan

People of Faith with Palestine in Struggle

Our world is in crisis. We face a growing, more aggressive empire with an insatiable appetite for consuming the resources of our world, subverting justice and humanity by its desire to strengthen its global hegemony; destroying the environment; feeding racist ideologies and practices of discrimination and marginalisation based on ethnicity; and driven by a patriarchal system and misogynist construction, which reinforce the power of men over women and children, rendering them vulnerable and subject to abuse.

The manipulation of religion to legitimize hegemony and mystify power relations is a standard tool of empires. This is dramatically at work in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict; imperialised religion is utterly entangled in the project of domination.

We, people of different faith traditions and ideological convictions, together with representatives of movements for justice and peace from 16 countries in Asia and the Middle East, Europe, North America, South America, and Africa, unite to seize this opportunity in obedience to the imperatives of our faiths and consciences to raise our voices loudly in the face of this danger and threat to all our lives and dignity.

For the US Empire, the 'primary, vital focus' is the Middle East; Occupied Palestine is at the centre of this imperial project and dreams of conquest. Today, meeting on the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Resolution 181 partitioning Palestine and on the eve of the 60th year of the Palestinian Nakba (catastrophe), our commitment drives us to engage more strenuously in the struggle to break the yoke of empire, build a global community of justice and peace, and be in solidarity with the resistance for the liberation of the Palestinian people, based on our firm conviction that international law is applicable to all.

The Middle East within the World (Dis)order of Global Empire

The United States is by circumstance and design a truly global empire. Its imperial ideology, military doctrine, and economics are correlative, and have been shaped with the Middle East as the focus. Military might justified by a doctrine of pre-emption is put to work to ensure the success of the plan for world economic dominance. In this design, Empire, the Middle East, and Israel are of a piece.

The post-September 11 reality has been dominated by the doctrine and strategy of 'the war on terror', which has nothing to do with human security or counter terrorism, but an ideological veil for empire building: brutal, military occupation, regime change, direct control of economic resources, unbridled expansion, racism, and xenophobia.

With the military occupation of Iraq, a new world (dis)order is extending an arc of instability, chaos, and violence in the service of hegemony. Under the cynical banner of democracy and peace, the empire seeks to control the key resources of the Middle East, especially oil reserves. As Michael Klare puts it, "Controlling Iraq is about oil as power, rather than oil as fuel. . . . Control over the Persian Gulf translates into control over Europe, Japan, and China."

The imperial vision for a "new Middle East" -- as a geo-political key to global hegemony -- is a confluence of US-UK-Israeli interests; it has economic, strategic and military designs, which requires restructuring and redrawing of the borders and power relations for the whole region. Its success relies on the capacity of the US Empire to construct and instrumentalise Middle East client states and regimes to support its policies; a firm US alliance with right-wing rulers to provide military bases, intelligence, and political backing for the colonial occupation of Iraq as well as economic sanctions and a possible war against Iran; and the power and influence of Israel on US political institutions.

Israel is more than a simple pawn or client state of US Empire -- it has assumed the status of a sacred trust in imperial theology and a mythical place in its imagination. It is central in the imperial plan "to create a new playing field" in the Middle East as a key to global hegemony.

Israel's Colonial Occupation and Apartheid

Empire manifests itself in different forms in different parts of the world. Colonialism, occupation and apartheid are three of its brutal faces that show themselves in Israel and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.

The occupation of the West Bank and Gaza is a continuation of a project of colonialism begun in the late 19th Century. Between 1947 and 1948, 750,000 Palestine's indigenous population suffered massacres, intimidation, and land grabbing of more than 78 percent of their territory; 531 villages and towns razed to the ground and wiped off the map, ensuring the decades-long displacement of millions of Palestinian children, women and men. Land continues to be stolen and settlements built on Palestinian land for the exclusive use of Jewish colonists. The Israeli project was never confined to historic Palestine, and even today other Arab territories remain under occupation.

Palestinians who remained in what became the Israeli state in 1948 have been forced to live as lesser citizens in an apartheid ethnocracy, a system founded on pillage and predicated on exclusivity of rights and privileges granted to or denied of people on the basis of their ethnicity.

Israel is an apartheid state: the rights to land ownership and use are determined according to one's ethnicity; so are citizenship rights, the decision of the locality where one lives, welfare benefits, access to basic services such as water, electricity, sewage, and roads -- as in the "unrecognised villages". Ethnic separation and privileging are established through various instruments such as the Absentee Property Law, the Citizenship Law, the Law of Entry, the Law of Return, the Military Service Law, and in judicial decisions.

Through the occupation, Israel violates Palestinians' right to free religious expression, as it denies them access to various holy sites such as Haram al-Sharif, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Church of Nativity and the Ibrahimi Mosque. Non-Palestinian and non-Israeli adherents of various religions are discriminated against, with clergy not being allowed to live and serve in the occupied territory.

Israel is trying various means to reduce the number of Palestinians in the occupied lands: illegal annexation of East Jerusalem after the 1967 war; Israeli control of the municipal council and its policies; isolation of the city from neighbouring Palestinian areas; house demolitions; land confiscations; expansion of settlements; racist residency legislation inhibiting unification of and free access to families. These measures force Jerusalemites out of the city while damaging its social, economic, health and educational sectors and jeopardising a future political settlement, thus rendering the achievement of a viable Palestinian state impossible.

The Apartheid Wall, eight metres high, snaking 750 kilometres across the West Bank when finished -- pronounced illegal by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice issued in 2004 -- is separating Palestinian farmers from their land, children from their schools, choking some towns in a huge and blatant land grab.

The Wall is structured to separate the Israeli settlements only from the Palestinian indigenous population, for the colonial infrastructure includes a complex web of roads -- restricted to vehicles with Israeli license plates -- that connect Israeli neighbourhoods and centres; it colonises underground Palestinian water supplies mainly for exploitation by Israelis while Palestinians are forced to pay ridiculously high prices to Israel for their own water; it has established a pernicious system of checkpoints that terrorise the indigenous population on a daily basis, restricts their movement, deprives them of their livelihoods, forces women to give birth in ambulances, denies them a proper education, causes a sustained humiliation of Palestinians.

Israel, in its treatment of the Palestinian population whose land it has occupied, continues to be in violation of various instruments of international law. It has rejected with impunity, the United Nations resolutions relating to the borders of the Israeli state, the right of return of Palestinian refugees and the international status of Jerusalem along with the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention relating to the rights of occupied populations. Despite possessing around 400 nuclear weapons, it refuses to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

Israel currently holds 11,000 Palestinian political prisoners, including hundreds of children; the vast majority of whom are held without due process, and many are subjected to torture and inhumane treatment. Military, political, and judicial authorities have contemptuously rejected the International Humanitarian Law regarding Torture and the Treatment of Prisoners.

Flagrant disregard for international law is upheld by the United States as evidenced by its consistent exercise of its UN Security Council veto power -- a privilege of being a permanent member -- in the service of Israeli impunity. The complacency of the entire Council makes it complicit in preventing the enforcement and implementation of international law.

Just peace for Palestine is an essential precondition for peace in the rest of the Middle East; and global peace requires Middle East peace as a prerequisite.

Liberating Imperialised Religion

The global empire not only justifies its actions in the name of peace, security, and democracy, it has also its own all pervasive and well articulated theology. The United States laces its foreign policy pronouncements with visions from God, references to the Almighty, and specific interpretations of Biblical texts. Theological language is used to legitimize war, defend 'Holy Jerusalem', and destroy wicked 'Babylon' (Iraq); the demonisation of Islam and projection of an axis of evil is imbued with a divine mandate.

As people of faith and conscience, we believe that forging a just peace includes liberating religion itself and requires counter-imperial expressions of faith. We seek to extricate ourselves from its imperialisation and manipulation. Each of us, from our own traditions and convictions, seeks to embrace a counter-imperial faith which is rooted in the call to fullness of life for all. We repudiate all attempts to put religion at the service of empire and domination, and we pledge to the specifically theological task of delegitimising the false religious claims of the project of domination.

This counter-imperial faith is based on a radical spirituality which places love and compassion for human beings and all of creation at the centre of its praxis. It embraces a clear analysis of empire and a firm determination against it. It is also in support of those struggling against empire and all forms of injustice. Nevertheless, while we recognise the injustice and oppression of empire in general and of the Israeli military machine in particular, we, nonetheless, affirm our common humanity with the perpetrators of this oppression and express the hope that the power of unconditional love will make them part of a global community of justice and compassion.

Mobilizing for a Just Peace

The occupation within the project of empire destroys life, institutionalizes human suffering, and assaults human dignity, but it cannot destroy the hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian people for freedom, justice, peace, and self-determination.

Our counter-imperial faith convictions are inspired and emboldened by the courageous, daily, dramatic and artful resistance of Palestinians to the apartheid and occupation in their lands. Thus inspired, we all commit ourselves to work for justice within our own contexts:

We join ourselves to their unquenchable hope and pledge our solidarity in the spirituality and practice of resistance to empire.

We commit ourselves to principled support of the Palestinian people in their resistance against military occupation and apartheid.

We reaffirm our support for the Palestinian people in their struggle for self-determination, and for the establishment of a sovereign, viable and contiguous Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.

We accept the challenge of the 2007 Amman conference of the World Council of Churches to insist that Palestinian refugees have the right of return to their homes, and to raise our voices and "name with courage the injustices we see and experience" of the illegal occupation, which has destroyed lives and brought forth nihilism and rage.

Our Pledge

Because we cannot remain silent, we have been in dialogue and offer the words of this document. Because we cannot remain separate, we have come together in Amman after a peace pilgrimage to Palestine -- as Jews, Christians, Hindus, and Muslims -- who make this appeal to all faiths and to conscience. Because we cannot remain still, we call for key focused actions to strengthen a counter-imperial faith in solidarity with Palestine and all those who suffer under empire.

We specifically pledge ourselves

To convene an interfaith reflection event on the spirituality of resistance and counter-imperial faith preferably in Jerusalem, initiated by Peace for Life;

To take part in activities to mark the 60th anniversary of the Nakba (2008) and link these with Peace for Life programmes;

To be responsive to and vigilant of the media to ensure that the Palestinian situation is justly interpreted and an alternative narrative finds space.

To inform and gather our network, especially from the global South, to visit the Occupied Palestinian Territories and to have Palestine storytellers a chance to relate their stories to people in countries closely allied with Israel;

To organise active participation in existing BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel) campaigns, and for PfL to focus one specific action campaign;

To intensify lobbying efforts with government bodies, multilateral agencies, and the United Nations to enforce Israeli compliance with international law and UN resolutions.

&amp;quot;The precious existence of women as the manifestation of divine beauty and as the peak of kindness, affection and purity has been the target of heavy exploitation in recent decades by the holders of power and owners of media and wealth. In some societies, this beloved human has been reduced to a mere instrument of publicity... &amp;quot;

Whoever kills an innocent soul.. it is as if he killed the whole of mankind, And whoever saves one, it is as if he saved the whole of mankind [The Holy Quran, 5:32]

Today sees the official launch of the Islam is Peace advertising campaign supported by the Muslim Council of Britain , coinciding with the law banning incitement to religious hatred coming into force. News of the campaign features on BBC Online :

Organisers say research shows many Britons associate Islam with terrorism. The group insists that the religion demands that its followers live in peace with their neighbours within non-Muslim societies .

The use of the verb &amp;quot;insist&amp;quot; is interesting - it would seem to imply the BBC itself is not entirely convinced, and what with its seemingly endless Panoramo programmes on Muslim extremism - one is broadcast on BBC 2 at 8:30pm this evening - no one should be too suprised at that. The adjunct &amp;quot;within non-Muslim societies&amp;quot; is odd - are we to assume that within Muslim socieities, Muslims and non-Muslims squabble?

Fair to the BBC, there is evidently goodwill towards Muslims in some quarters, not least on the Religions and Ethics section of its website. In addition, following tonight's Panorama on HT, there is a real treat - an hour long programme about the Shariah produced by a Muslim film maker. Hence, it's about the 'real' Shariah, not the Islamophobic fantasy of endless beheadings and amputations that somehow ignores the lethal injectionings and electrocutions of black people in the USA.

Back to Islam in Peace. The Press release (pdf) includes the following statement:

The Campaign aims to correct misconceptions about British Muslims and their faith and help create a more tolerant and inclusive society. In July this year, full-page advertisements were placed under the banner 'Muslims United' in leading tabloid and broadsheet papers clearly stating the Muslim community's unequivocal condemnation of all acts of terrorism. The advertising campaign on the tube, trains, stations and airports will emphasise the diversity and positive contribution of British Muslims and the integral role they play in everyday life.

Ifhat Shaheen-Smith , one of the campaign organisers said, &amp;quot;in the current atmosphere of suspicion and fear about Islam and British Muslims, truth is often confused with fabrications and stereotypes. Prejudice has become entrenched and sensationalistic media reporting is creating a climate of paranoia. There is a desperate need for openness, mutual understanding and a mature debate.&amp;quot;

Through images of Muslims in various fields and professions, from medicine to the police service and from art to football, the adverts seek to emphasise that British Muslims are proud of their identity whilst playing their full role in making Britain a more united and prosperous society.

This advertising campaign will need to be a sustained one if it is counter the inevitable reactionary nonsense from the usual suspects. As the official launch is taking place in London today, there is not much in the news as yet. The website itself is worth a look, although the &amp;quot;who are we?&amp;quot; slick video with its close up faces, weepy background music and cute little kids is a little too sick-bags-at-the-ready for my taste.

I certainly welcome the campaign and the planned nationwide tour. However, we need much more than a single, loud, alternative message - we need loud, alternative message s - i.e. more grass roots online responses. In the UK, there would seem to be a particular paucity of individual bloggers committed to tackling Islamophobia in the media, to the extent I can count them on one hand- Indigo Jo Blogs, Rolled-up Trousers, Yahya Birt and of course the wonderful Islamophobia Watch. Okay, and me.

Part of the problem, I suspect, is the attitude reflected in some of the negative comments I've heard expressed by Muslim clevers about grassroot groups being &amp;quot;arrogant and ignorant&amp;quot; etc - however, you rarely hear of such people volunteering to advice such groups. If campaigns like this are going to work, they need to empower ordinary people to generate their own responses. Let's stop relying so much on leaders and wheelers and dealers and do something ourselves. Beginning today.

Ps. If you're blogging on Muslims in the UK media and are not mentioned here, then drop me a comment or email me via my website .

Responding to Left-Liberal Islamophobia

There are two recent articles that are worth a critical read because, while from the secularist-left, they both provide a response to left-liberal Islamophobia. Both articles provide a more complex view of Islamic movements, than some of the other outright Islamophobic liberal-leftists.

The first is by Ali Abunimah, titled Engaging Hamas and Hizballah , and the second is an interview of a Jordanian Marxist, Hisham Bustani .

I'll first comment on some of the assertions made by Hisham Bustani and then, in another post later this week, address some of the issues raised by Ali Abunimah.

Bustani correctly concludes his interview with the following:

&amp;quot; Overall and as a prime desideratum, there is a huge and pressing imperative today for Left unity, of all its currents: the left of the Islamic movement, the left of the nationalist movement, and the left of the leftist progressive and revolutionary movement, on the basis of a program of resistance, liberation, and political clarity. The opposing Right of all those currents is already united and taking action.&amp;quot;

Bustani recognizes the importance of the secular left uniting with (the left of) Islamic movements - he appears to have some understanding that the secular left is largely irrelevant, and have only a small, if any, mass base amongst Muslims anywhere in the world.

&amp;quot; Of course, there are also opportunist leftists (NGO beneficiaries and Marxists-turned-liberals) and xenophobic nationalists (with fascist tendencies against Iranians, Kurds, and Turks), but these phenomena are only trivial, since their currents are too weak to take the streets and challenge existing power.&amp;quot;

The force and power of the secular left-liberal is amongst the anti-war groupings in the US and Europe, i.e within the heart of the empire. More often than not, these left-liberals (mostly Whites) will give voice to unrepresentative secularists from Muslim majority countries, who will then proceed to demonize Islamic groups in a language similar to the neo-cons. This same language (example: &amp;quot;mullah&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ayatullah&amp;quot; bashing) is then picked up by the left-liberals, and replayed over and over and over again in articles and at supposedly anti-war talks and events.

Because the secularists do not have a mass base, if there is to be &amp;quot;unity&amp;quot; of the sort that Bustani suggests, then we all must also take into account this relative insignificance of left-liberal groups and individuals. The secularist ideology of small (often elite) minorities cannot be allowed to dictate to a mass that obviously has a far more religious social identity. This is the point, over which, Islamic movements will inevitably clash with secularists. There is no way any self-respecting Muslim will hang out with any secularist-leftist group of individuals, who insist on portraying themselves as superior to a religious faith.

Of-course, the Islamic groups are all not the same, and, as Bustani correctly points out, some are indeed outright opportunists, and so this is not to suggest that Muslims should not also take a critical look at the Islamic movements. But such a critical look must be from within Islam, with a goal of moving the movements towards developing a social justice framework rooted in Islam - not towards an anti-religious secular (separate everything) direction, as has been the opportunistic projects of &amp;quot;moderate/progressive/enlightened moderate&amp;quot; Muslims.

Bustani says:

The second prime project in the Arab region is the Iranian project. Its problematic aspect is that it is not a liberation project, but rather it is predicated on an agenda of expansion with nationalist and sectarian aspects. Although it collides with the U.S. and its imperialist orientation, the Iranian regime's struggle with imperialism is on the basis of benefits and spheres of influence, not geared to a politics of liberation.

There is some truth to what Bustani states, but not entirely: There is no question that there are sections of Iranian politics that are indeed sectarian, but if Iran's support of Hizbullah is any indiction, it also true that the movements that may have been once nurtured by Iran are also by and large independent. Notions that one hears from the left, from time to time, that Iran is in control of all politics of Hizbullah (i.e. making it sectarian) do not jive with how indigenous movements evolve and grow - and the fact that they cannot have such wide popularity, and a huge mass base if they were not indigenous.

If Hizbullah does not have as much of a mass following in Lebanon's Sunni communities, then the finger must be pointed to the sectarianism perpetuated by &amp;quot;Saudi&amp;quot; Arabia that has effectively poisoned (at the behest of the US) Islamic discourse amongst many Sunnis. Indeed it was &amp;quot;Saudi&amp;quot; who, recognizing the threat that the Islamic Revolution of Iran posed to their power, and the wide popularity that it enjoyed amongst large numbers of Sunnis, went into high gear, publishing anti-Shi'a tracts, and books that demonized Imam Khomeni's ideological content. In this respect, they were far more successful than the demonization campaign carried out by the United States, and the lslamophobic left-liberals. Infact, we saw the sectarian demonization by the &amp;quot;Saudis&amp;quot; go into high gear again, immediately after the 33 day war, when Hizbullah had gained wide popularity amongst many Sunnis.

Iran no doubt has its flaws, but the Islamic Revolution - as a &amp;quot;project&amp;quot; was &amp;quot;sectarian&amp;quot; only because Iran is predominately Shi'a --- the actual ideological content is, infact, anti-sectarian. If Iran has more recently veered off this path somewhat, then that is a reflection of internal political struggles and factions. And this is where (as Bustani correctly implies) Muslims also need to identify those currents within Iran, and within Islamic movements that are indeed anti-sectarian, anti-imperialist, and pursue the development of an Islamic vision of a socially just society - that is also not based on narrow nationalisms.

In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful...

The president recites verses from the holy Koran in Arabic.

&amp;quot;Oh, God, hasten the arrival of Imam al-Mahdi and grant him good health and victory and make us his followers and those to attest to his rightfulness.&amp;quot;

Distinguished Dean, dear professors and students, ladies and gentlemen, at the outset I would like to extend my
greetings to all of you. I am grateful to the almighty God for providing me with the opportunity to be in an academic environment, those seeking truth and striving for the promotion of science and knowledge.

At the outset I want to complain a bit from the person who read this political statement against me. In Iran tradition requires that when we demand a person to invite to be a speaker we actually respect our students and the professors by allowing them to make their own judgment and we don't think it's necessary before this speech is even given to come in with a series of claims and to attempt in a so-called manner to provide vaccination of some sort to our students and our faculty.

I think the text read by the dear gentleman here, more than addressing me, was an insult to information and the knowledge of the audience here. In a university environment we must allow people to speak their mind, to allow everyone to talk so that the truth is eventually revealed by all.

Certainly he took more than all the time I was allocated to speak, and that's fine with me. We'll just leave that to add up with the claims of respect for freedom and the freedom of speech that's given to us in this country.

Many parts of his speech, there were many insults and claims that were incorrect, regretfully.

Of course, I think that he was affected by the press, the media, and the political, sort of, mainstream line that you read here that goes against the very grain of the need for peace and stability in the world around us.
Nonetheless, I should not begin by being affected by this unfriendly treatment. I will tell you what I have to say, and then the questions he can raise and I'll be happy to provide answers. But as for one of the issues that he did raise, I most certainly would need to elaborate further so that we, for ourselves, can see how things fundamentally work.

It was my decision in this valuable forum and meeting to speak with you about the importance of knowledge, of information, of education. Academics and religious scholars are shining torches who shed light in order to remove darkness. And the ambiguities around us in guiding humanity out of ignorance and perplexity.
The key to the understanding of the realities around us rests in the hands of the researchers, those who seek to discover areas that are hidden, the unknown sciences, the windows of realities that they can open is done only through efforts of the scholars and the learned people in this world.

With every effort there is a window that is opened, and one reality is discovered. Whenever the high stature of science and wisdom is preserved and the dignity of scholars and researchers are respected, humans have taken great strides toward their material and spiritual promotion.

In contrast, whenever learned people and knowledge have been neglected, humans have become stranded in the darkness of ignorance and negligence.

If it were not for human instinct, which tends toward continual discovery of truth, humans would have always remained stranded in ignorance and no way would not have discovered how to improve the life that we are given.
The nature of man is, in fact, a gift granted by the Almighty to all. The Almighty led mankind into this world and granted him wisdom and knowledge as his prime gift enabling him to know his God.

In the story of Adam, a conversation occurs between the Almighty and his angels. The angels call human beings an ambitious and merciless creature and protested against his creation.

But the Almighty responded, quote, &amp;quot;I have knowledge of what you are ignorant of,&amp;quot; unquote. Then the Almighty told Adam the truth. And on the order of the Almighty, Adam revealed it to the angels.

The angels could not understand the truth as revealed by the human being. The Almighty said to them, quote, &amp;quot; Did not I say that I am aware of what is hidden in heaven and in the universe?&amp;quot; unquote. In this way the angels prostrated themselves before Adam.

In the mission of all divine prophets, the first sermons were of the words of God, and those words -- piety, faith and wisdom -- have been spread to all mankind.

... Regarding the holy prophet Moses, may peace be upon him, God says, quote, &amp;quot;And he was taught wisdom, the divine book, the Old Testament and the New Testament. He is the prophet appointed for the sake of the children of Israel, and I rightfully brought a sign from the Almighty, holy Koran,&amp;quot;

The first words, which were revealed to the holy prophet of Islam, call the prophet to read, quote, &amp;quot;Read, read in the name of your God, who supersedes everything,&amp;quot; unquote, the Almighty, quote again, &amp;quot;who taught the human being with the pen,&amp;quot; unquote. Quote, &amp;quot;The Almighty taught human beings what they were ignorant of,&amp;quot; unquote.
You see, in the first verses revealed to the holy prophet of Islam, words of reading, teaching and the pen are mentioned. These verses in fact introduced the Almighty as the teacher of human beings, the teacher who taught humans what they were ignorant of.

In another part of the Koran, on the mission of the holy prophet of Islam, it is mentioned that the Almighty appointed someone from amongst the common people as their prophet in order to, quote, &amp;quot;read for them the divine verses,&amp;quot; unquote, and quote again, &amp;quot;and purify them from ideological and ethical contamination&amp;quot; unquote, and quote again, &amp;quot;to teach them the divine book and wisdom,&amp;quot; unquote.

My dear friends, all the words and messages of the divine prophets from Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, to David and Solomon and Moses, to Jesus and Mohammad delivered humans from ignorance, negligence, superstitions, unethical behavior, and corrupted ways of thinking, with respect to knowledge, on the path to knowledge, light and rightful ethics.

In our culture, the word science has been defined as illumination.

In fact, the science means brightness and the real science is a science which rescues the human being from ignorance, to his own benefit. In one of the widely accepted definitions of science, it is stated that it is the light which sheds to the hearts of those who have been selected by the almighty.

Therefore, according to this definition, science is a divine gift and the heart is where it resides. If we accept that science means illumination, then its scope supersedes the experimental sciences and it includes every hidden and disclosed reality.

One of the main harms inflicted against science is to limit it to experimental and physical sciences. This harm occurs even though it extends far beyond this scope. Realities of the world are not limited to physical realities and the materials, just a shadow of supreme reality. And physical creation is just one of the stories of the creation of the world.

Human being is just an example of the creation that is a combination of a material and the spirit. And another important point is the relationship of science and purity of spirit, life, behavior and ethics of the human being. In the teachings of the divine prophets, one reality shall always be attached to science; the reality of purity of spirit and good behavior. Knowledge and wisdom is pure and clear reality.

It is -- science is a light. It is a discovery of reality. And only a pure scholar and researcher, free from wrong ideologies, superstitions , selfishness and material trappings can discover -- discover the reality.
My dear friends and scholars, distinguished participants, science and wisdom can also be misused, a misuse caused by selfishness, corruption, material desires and material interests, as well as individual and group interests.

Material desires place humans against the realities of the world.

Corrupted and dependent human beings resist acceptance of reality. And even if they do accept it, they do not obey it.

There are many scholars who are aware of the realities but do not accept them. Their selfishness does not allow them to accept those realities.

Do those who, in the course of human history, wage wars, not understand the reality that lives, properties, dignity, territories, and the rights of all human beings should be respected, or did they understand it but neither have faith in nor abide by it?

My dear friends, as long as the human heart is not free from hatred, envy, and selfishness, it does not abide by the truth, by the illumination of science and science itself.

Science is the light, and scientists must be pure and pious. If humanity achieves the highest level of physical and spiritual knowledge but its scholars and scientists are not pure, then this knowledge cannot serve the interests of humanity, and several events can ensue.

First, the wrongdoers reveal only a part of the reality, which is to their own benefit, and conceal the rest. As we have witnessed with respect to the scholars of the divine religions in the past, too, unfortunately, today, we see that certain researchers and scientists are still hiding the truth from the people.

Second, science, scientists, and scholars are misused for personal, group, or party interests. So, in today's world, bullying powers are misusing many scholars and scientists in different fields with the purpose of stripping nations of their wealth.

... And they use all opportunities only for their own benefit. For example, they deceive people by using scientific methods and tools. They, in fact, wish to justify their own wrongdoings, though. By creating nonexistent enemies, for example, and an insecure atmosphere, they try to control all in the name of combating insecurity and terrorism.

They even violate individual and social freedoms in their own nations under that pretext. They do not respect the privacy of their own people. They tap telephone calls and try to control their people.

They create an insecure psychological atmosphere in order to justify their warmongering acts in different parts of the world.

As another example, by using precise scientific methods and planning, they begin their onslaught on the domestic cultures of nations, the cultures which are the result of thousands of years of interaction, creativity and artistic activities.

They try to eliminate these cultures in order to separate the people from their identity and cut their bonds with their own history and values. They prepare the ground for stripping people from their spiritual and material wealth by instilling in them feelings of intimidation, desire for imitation and (inaudible) submission to oppressive powers and disability.

Making nuclear, chemical and biological bombs and weapons of mass destruction is yet another result of the misuse of science and research by the big powers. Without cooperation of certain scientists and scholars, we would not have witnessed production of different nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Are these weapons to protect global security?

What can a perpetual nuclear umbrella threat achieve for the sake of humanity? If nuclear war wages between nuclear powers, what human catastrophe will take place?

Today we can see the nuclear effects in even new generations of Nagasaki and Hiroshima residents, which might be witnessed in even the next generations to come.

Presently, the effects of the depleted uranium used in weapons since the beginning of the war in Iraq can be examined and investigated accordingly.

These catastrophes take place only when scientists and scholars are misused by oppressors.

Another point of sorrow: Some big powers create a monopoly over science and prevent other nations in achieving scientific development as well.

This, too, is one of the surprises of our time. Some big powers do not want to see the progress of other societies and nations. They turn to thousands of reasons, make allegations, place economic sanctions to prevent other nations from developing and advancing, all resulting from their distance from human values and the teachings of the divine prophets.

Regretfully, they have not been trained to serve mankind.

Dear academics, dear faculty and scholars, students, I believe that the biggest God-given gift to man is science and knowledge. Man's search for knowledge and the truth through science is what it guarantees to do in getting close to God.

But science has to combine with the purity of the spirit and of the purity of man's spirit so that scholars can unveil the truth and then use that truth for advancing humanity's cause.

These scholars would be not only people who would guide humanity, but also guide humanity towards a better future.

And it is necessary that big powers should not allow mankind to engage in monopolistic activities and to prevent other nations from achieving that science. Science is a divine gift by God to everyone, and therefore, it must remain pure.

God is aware of all reality. All researchers and scholars are loved by God. So I hope there will be a day where these scholars and scientists will rule the world and God himself will arrive with Moses and Christ and Mohammed to rule the world and to take us toward justice.

I'd like to thank you now but refer to two points made in the introduction given about me, and then I will be open for any questions.

Last year -- I would say two years ago -- I raised two questions.

You know that my main job is a university instructor.

Right now, as president of Iran, I still continue teaching graduate and Ph.D.-level courses on a weekly basis. My students are working with me in scientific fields. I believe that I am an academic, myself. So I speak with you from an academic point of view, and I raised two questions.

But, instead of a response, I got a wave of insults and allegations against me. And regretfully, they came mostly from groups who claimed most to believe in the freedom of speech and the freedom of information. You know quite well that Palestine is an old wound, as old as 60 years. For 60 years, these people are displaced. For 60 years, these people are being killed. For 60 years, on a daily basis, there's conflict and terror. For 60 years, innocent women and children are destroyed and killed by helicopters and airplanes that break the house over their heads. For 60 years, children and kindergartens, in schools, in high schools, are in prison being tortured. For 60 years, security in the Middle East has been endangered. For 60 years, the slogan of expansionism from the Nile to the Euphrates is being chanted by certain groups in that part of the world.

And as an academic, I asked two questions; the same two questions that I will ask here again. And you judge, for yourselves, whether the response to these questions should be the insults, the allegations, and all the words and the negative propaganda or should we really try and face these two questions and respond to them? Like you, like any academic, I, too, will keep -- not yet become silent until I get the answer. So I'm awaiting logical answers instead of insults.

My first question was if -- given that the Holocaust is a present reality of our time, a history that occurred, why is there not sufficient research that can approach the topic from different perspectives?

Our friend referred to 1930 as the point of departure for this development. However, I believe the Holocaust from what we've read happened during World War II, after 1930, in the 1940s. So, you know, we have to really be able to trace the event.

My question was simple: There are researchers who want to approach the topic from a different perspective. Why are they put into prison? Right now, there are a number of European academics who have been sent to prison because they attempted to write about the Holocaust or research it from a different perspective, questioning certain aspects of it.

My question is: Why isn't it open to all forms of research? I have been told that there's been enough research on the topic. And I ask, well, when it comes to topics such as freedom, topics such as democracy, concepts and norms such as God, religion, physics even, or chemistry, there's been a lot of research, but we still continue more research on those topics. We encourage it.

But, then, why don't we encourage more research on a historical event that has become the root, the cause of many heavy catastrophes in the region in this time and age?

Why shouldn't there be more research about the root causes? That was my first question.

And my second question, well, given this historical event, if it is a reality, we need to still question whether the Palestinian people should be paying for it or not. After all, it happened in Europe. The Palestinian people had no role to play in it. So why is it that the Palestinian people are paying the price of an event they had nothing to do with?

The Palestinian people didn't commit any crime. They had no role to play in World War II. They were living with the Jewish communities and the Christian communities in peace at the time. They didn't have any problems.
And today, too, Jews, Christians and Muslims live in brotherhood all over the world in many parts of the world.

They don't have any serious problems.

But why is it that the Palestinians should pay a price, innocent Palestinians, for 5 million people to remain displaced or refugees abroad for 60 years. Is this not a crime? Is asking about these crimes a crime by itself?
Why should an academic myself face insults when asking questions like this? Is this what you call freedom and upholding the freedom of thought?

And as for the second topic, Iran's nuclear issue, I know there is time limits, but I need time. I mean, a lot of time was taken from me.

We are a country, we are a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency. For over 33 years we are a member state of the agency.

The bylaw of the agency explicitly states that all member states have the right to the peaceful nuclear fuel technology. This is an explicit statement made in the bylaw, and the bylaw says that there is no pretext or excuse, even the inspections carried by the IAEA itself that can prevent member states' right to have that right.
Of course, the IAEA is responsible to carry out inspections. We are one of the countries that's carried out the most amount of level of cooperation with the IAEA. They have had hours and weeks and days of inspections in our country, and over and over again the agency's reports indicate that Iran's activities are peaceful, that they have not detected a deviation, and that Iran -- they have received positive cooperation from Iran.

But regretfully, two or three monopolistic powers, selfish powers want to force their word on the Iranian people and deny them their right.

They tell us you don't let them -- they won't let them inspect. Why not? Of course we do. How come is it, anyway, that you have that right and we can't have it? We want to have the right to peaceful nuclear energy. They tell us, don't make it yourself, we'll give it to you.

Well, in the past, I tell you, we had contracts with the U.S. government, with the British government, the French government, the German government, and the Canadian government on nuclear development for peaceful purposes. But unilaterally, each and every one of them canceled their contracts with us, as a result of which the Iranian people had to pay a heavy cost in billions of dollars.

Why do we need the fuel from you? You've not even given us spare aircraft parts that we need for civilian aircraft for 28 years under the name of embargo and sanctions because we're against, for example, human rights or freedom? Under that pretext, you deny us that technology? We want to have the right to self-determination toward our future. We want to be independent. Don't interfere in us.

If you don't give us spare parts for civilian aircraft, what is the expectation that you'd give us fuel for nuclear development for peaceful purposes?

For 30 years, we've faced these problems for over $5 billion to the Germans and then to the Russians, but we haven't gotten anything.

And the words have not been completed.

It is our right. We want our right. And we don't want anything beyond the law, nothing less than international law.

We are a peaceful, loving nation. We love all nations.

At the end of President Ahmadinejad's speech, he responded to questions posed by some students.

MODERATOR: Mr. President, your statements here today and in the past have provoked many questions which I would like to pose to you on behalf of the students and faculty who have submitted them to me.

Let me begin with the question to which you just alluded.

The first question is: Do you or your government seek the destruction of the state of Israel as a Jewish state?

AHMADINEJAD: We love all nations. We are friends with the Jewish people. There are many Jews in Iran, leaving peacefully, with security.

You must understand that in our constitution and our laws and in the parliamentary elections for every 150,000 people, we get one representative in the parliament. For the Jewish community, for one- fifth of this number, they still get one independent representative in the parliament.

So our proposal to the Palestinian plight is a humanitarian and democratic proposal. What we say is that to solve this 60-year problem, we must allow the Palestinian people to decide about its future for itself.

This is compatible with the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and the fundamental principles enshrined in it. We must allow Jewish Palestinians, Muslim Palestinians and Christian Palestinians to determine their own fate themselves through a free referendum.

Whatever they choose as a nation, everybody should accept and respect. Nobody should interfere in the affairs of the Palestinian nation. Nobody should sow the seeds of discord. Nobody should spend tens of billions of dollars equipping and arming one group there.

We say allow the Palestinian nation to decide its own future, to have the right to self-determination for itself. This is what we are saying as the Iranian nation.

MODERATOR: Mr. President, I think many members of our audience would like to hear a clearer answer to that question. The question is:

Do you or your government seek the destruction of the state of Israel as a Jewish state? And I think you could answer that question with a single word, either yes or no.

AHMADINEJAD: You asked the question, and then you want the answer the way you want to hear it. Well, this isn't really a free flow of information.

I'm just telling you what my position is. I'm asking you: Is the Palestinian issue not an international issue of prominence or not? Please tell me, yes or no? There's the plight of a people.

MODERATOR: The answer to your question is yes.

AHMADINEJAD: Well, thank you for your cooperation . We recognize there's a problem there that's been going on for 60 years. Everybody provides a solution. And our solution is a free referendum.
Let this referendum happen, and then you'll see what the results are.

Let the people of Palestine freely choose what they want for their future. And then what you want in your mind to happen there will happen and will be realized.

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) second question, which was posed by President Bollinger earlier and comes from a number of other students:

Why is your government providing aid to terrorists? Will you stop doing so and permit international monitoring to certify that you have stopped?

AHMADINEJAD: Well, I want to pose a question here to you. If someone comes and explodes bombs around you, threatens your president, members of the administration, kills the members of the Senate or Congress, how would you treat them?

Would you reward them, or would you name them a terrorist group? Well, it's clear. You would call them a terrorist.

My dear friends, the Iranian nation is a victim of terrorism. For --26 years ago, where I worked, close to where I worked, in a terrorist operation, the elected president of the Iranian nation and the elected prime minister of Iran lost their lives in a bomb explosion. They turned into ashes.

A month later, in another terrorist operation, 72 members of our parliament and highest-ranking officials, including four ministers and eight deputy ministers' bodies were shattered into pieces as a result of terrorist attacks.

Within six months, over 4,000 Iranians lost their lives, assassinated by terrorist groups. All this carried out by the hand of one single terrorist group. Regretfully, that same terrorist group now, today, in your country, is being -- operating under the support of the U.S. administration, working freely, distributing declarations freely, and their camps in Iraq are supported by the U.S. government.

They're secured by the U.S. government. Our nation has been harmed by terrorist activities. We were the first nation that objected to terrorism and the first to uphold the need to fight terrorism.

We need to address the root causes of terrorism and eradicate those root causes. We live in the Middle East.

For us, it's quite clear which powers, sort of, incite terrorists, support them, fund them. We know that. Our nation, the Iranian nation, through history has always extended a hand of friendship to other nations. We're a cultured nation. We don't need to resort to terrorism. We've been victims of terrorism, ourselves. And it's regrettable that people who argue they're fighting terrorism, instead of supporting the Iranian people and nation, instead of fighting the terrorists that are attacking them, they're supporting the terrorists and then turn the fingers to us. This is most regrettable.

QUESTION: Mr. President, a further set of questions challenged your view of the Holocaust. Since the evidence that this occurred in Europe in the 1940s, as a result of the actions of the German Nazi government, since that -- those facts -- are well documented, why are you calling for additional research? There seems to be no purpose in doing so, other than to question whether the Holocaust actually occurred as a historical fact. Can you explain why you believe more research is needed into the facts of what are what are incontrovertible?

AHMADINEJAD: Thank you very much for your question. I am an academic, and you are as well. Can you argue that researching a phenomenon is finished, forever done? Can we close the books for good on a historical event?
There are different perspectives that come to light after every research is done. Why should we stop research at all? Why should we stop the progress of science and knowledge?

You shouldn't ask me why I'm asking questions. You should ask yourselves why you think that that's questionable? Why do you want to stop the progress of science and research?

Do you ever take what's known as absolute in physics? We had principles in mathematics that were granted to be absolute in mathematics for over 800 years. But new science has gotten rid of those absolutisms, come forward other different logics of looking at mathematics and sort of turned the way we look at it as a science altogether after 800 years.

So, we must allow researchers, scholars, they investigate into everything, every phenomenon -- God, universe, human beings, history and civilization. Why should we stop that?

I am not saying that it didn't happen at all. This is not that judgment that I am passing here. I said, in my second question, granted this happened, what does it have to do with the Palestinian people?

In case you were wondering who made the clothes you may be wearing these days...

It is interesting to note that while so-called Progressive-Modernist-Moderates (i.e. the allies of Imperialism and Neo-Colonialism) love to point fingers at Muslims about &amp;quot;women's rights.&amp;quot; Rarely, if ever, do they address the corporate control of women in the &amp;quot;third world.&amp;quot;

The reason they don't address these issues is because, as part of the elite of Muslim majority countries, they benefit from the economic, and sexual exploitation (brothels and prostitution) of Muslim women. If they were raise the issues of such exploitation, the finger would point right back at 'em - after all it is these liberals who have made deals with major American and European corporations to open up abusive factories.

Next time you hear about anyone wanting to make any Muslim majority country into a &amp;quot;moderate modern progressive&amp;quot; nation - remember this video - this is what they mean:

(Of-course similar conditions exist in Mexico, Central and South America - and elsewhere).

left-liberal Islamophobia watch (III): the case of Iran

Almost every day, left-liberal publications slam Iran on something or the other - some of these articles are based on faux Iranian dissidents' initiatives, others are just straight up Islamophobic - and use the term &amp;quot;theocracy&amp;quot; pejoratively to describe the Islamic Republic. Yet other articles are written by liberal-imperialists (often including academic Muslims) who only differ with the neo-cons on the question of tactics, not with the goal of overthrowing the Islamic Republic, and replacing it with something called &amp;quot;democracy.&amp;quot;

Yes, I know, these articles, on the face of it, do not call for a military attack on Iran, but they do characterize Iran in a neo-conish light, that makes the country's government out to be a monster that must be overthrown - they then add the caveat &amp;quot;by its own people.&amp;quot; This is the kind of psuedo-intellectual acrobatics that quickly falls on its face, and ends up discrediting the liberal-left in the eyes of many Muslims.

All of these articles circulate the (often Islamophobic) North American left-liberal groups, and helps to create a monstrous image of Iran - rarely, if ever, does one read anything that gives facts and figures about Iran, what gains the country has made since the Islamic Revolution, and where the country might still have some work to do... And it is absolutely beyond any of the left-liberalists to actually understand the role that Iran has played in influencing Sunni Muslim majority countries to improve their treatment of the Shi'a minorities.

What is interesting about all of this is that the gains Iran has made since the Islamic Revolution is not hidden, infact much of the data is readily available from the site of the World Bank (of all places) and the various United Nations data banks. Infact, most recently the World Bank recognized Iran as being #1 in the middle east and north africa, for creating a positive working environment for women. Why is it that the imperialists are willing to be more objective in the data that they present, while the liberal-left refuses to consider these numbers, as a way to counter the extremist right wing? I think this is just an extension of Islamophobia, and more generally an anti-religion attitude that blinds the left-liberalists.

Following are some charts based on the World Bank data that shows some of the remarkable gains Iran has made since the Islamic Revolution:

Literacy Rate

Life Expectancy:

Immunization

Child Mortality

Contraceptive availability and Birth Rate

The night I visited Mr. A. was one of the most unforgettable nights.

Mr. A. is the person who gave lectures in Japan last year (in Kyoto, Tokyo and Osaka) on 'Dialogue among religious leaders on Palestinian/Israeli Conflict’. He is a lecturer at al-Quds University in Jerusalem and teaches Islamic Studies.

I caught a bus that runs on a highway to Jerusalem (Daria took me to the bus stop from nswas.) It was my first time to go outside of the village. I was a little bit nervous but excited. I got off the bus at the West Jerusalem bus center and went shopping to buy something for my friend who offered me to stay overnight at her place in Jerusalem. She has been working in Japanese Volunteer Center in Jerusalem for 5years, and goes back and forth between Israel and Japan. She was the translator for the lecture that Mr. A. gave in Japan.

I bought some presents and went to the bus station to go to East Jerusalem. When I was crossing the road, there was a policeman standing on the corner. When he saw me walking down the street, he came straight to me and asked me to show my passport. These things happen here frequently to people like me (i.e. Asians and Arabs). Fortunately, I was warned about this from some people and was prepared for this.

"Are you a Filipino?" I told him my nationality. Then he asked me to show my passport. I asked him where the bus station was to go to East Jerusalem, but he told me 'After you show your passport, I will tell you where it is.' Fair enough, Ha! I searched for my passport in my big backpack but there were many things in it, pajamas, books, a lamp (for a present), cookies, water, coin case etc. and it took me about 30 seconds to find it. During this time, he found another victim who wanted to pass by my side.

She had a bit of dark skin and thick black hair. The girl who was stopped by the police showed her ID card and explained something. The policeman seemed to be very mean to her. She was forced to sit on a stone by the pavement and looked up at him with fear in her eyes. She wasn’t doing anything wrong, but his attitude scared her. He didn't scare me as much because I am Japanese. What if I were a Filipino ? What if I came from Thailand?

I took a bus and left the bus station. It was almost 4:30pm when I reached the Yaffo Gate, the west side of the Old City. I ran into the Old City and went straight to the Damascus Gate. I couldn't find the shortest way, but I think I did well. But after I get out from the Old City, I wondered around on the streets for almost 20 minutes.

When I met Keiko at the Jerusalem Hotel, it was almost 5:00pm.

Keiko is really nice. She is something else. I have a kind of talent for recognizing nice people as soon as I meet. I had a kind of intuition, like 'I really like her' when I met her the last time.

Mr. A. is a handsome man who has 7 children and a beautiful wife. He lives on the edge of West Bank close to a refugee camp. We enjoyed ‘zahki’ dinner and conversation with his family.

He drove us to the bus stop where we could easily find the bus to East Jerusalem. When we went through a refugee camp, some Palestinian young boys around 12-15 years old were riding on the back of a pick up track. One boy got off the track and rushed to put a paper on the wall beside the pavement. "It is a poster of 'Mujahedeen' , isn't it?'" some one asked Mr. A., but he didn't answer. Probably, he was concentrating on driving on that narrow road where cars were coming straight to us with horrible speed. Or was he thinking about the police?

We safely reached the bus stop. We got on the bus and said good-bye to Mr. A..
After a few minutes, two young soldiers got on the bus at the check point. They asked us where we were from and we answered. They didn't ask us to show our passports and let us go with a smile. How is it possible for young men (they looked 23-27) like them to change into a person who could beat a little boy?

Traveling to Ramallah to visit Arafat’s grave and refugee camp was, again, postponed by the snow. I am not sure if I can visit there during the time of my stay. Instead, I asked my friend to reserve my seat of the tour around Hebron. She said I was on the waiting list, and she informed the agency of my leaving date.

I was told that I am quite lucky to be coming here around this time. "Some volunteers are good, but some of them are not. We've got the best members now," someone said. I admit that I am acting strange, probably as weird as I am in Japan or even more. But thanks to God, people are so nice and kind.

I will send you another story next time.

Dear Kiriko,

I thought, when I began to read your journal, that it might be helpful to you if I would take some notes to correct any obvious errors, or comment on things that you might need to think about more. I found just a few items (less than I expected).

"Hebrew is also the official language in NS-WAS. Not many Jews can understand Arabic, especially people who are immigrants from different countries."

Well, if there is such a thing as "official language" in a village, we do try to keep both languages as official, despite many obstacles. In almost all written notices, for instance, both languages are used. Recently we passed a rule that all department heads must be fluent in both languages and, if they are not, they must learn Arabic within 2 years.

In the meetings, people can speak in either language, though when Arabic is spoken, there is the obstacle that some of the Jews won't understand. Protocols for general assembly meetings are kept in Hebrew, partly because these are records that must be available for review by state authorities. Israel itself has Hebrew and Arabic as official languages - but this is a rule which isn't properly implemented.

"Jewish people in NS-WAS study Arabic once a week, but it is not enough to communicate with Arabs. Actually, they don't need to speak Arabic because Arabs speak Hebrew perfectly. There is no need, but people in NS-WAS knew that it was not fair. That is why they try to learn Arabic."

Not all Jews here learn Arabic weekly. Daria is the only Jew from the village currently attending A.'s classes. Many Jews in the village do know Arabic at a level that permits them to understand, even if they can't speak it well.

Languages don't just communicate ideas. They also communicate feelings and various subtle things. Even when a person is fluent in another language, she might not be able to communicate well nuances of feeling, etc.

"Jewish people know what they are doing to Palestinians more or less. But some people are afraid of leaving Israel. Once they express or accept the things they are doing, they think they have to leave. .."

I'm not sure what you mean here. As a straight statement about Israeli Jews in general, I'm not sure that it is true. Many Israeli Jews know very well what they are doing, and can offer many arguments for continuing. Other Israeli Jews reject what their government is doing and decide to stay and struggle against government policy.

"...However, people that I met here became angry at seeing what the settlers and soldiers were doing to the people in Palestine. Every Friday, women gather and demonstrate against the settlers in front of the old city…"

I don't think the people you heard about in the Women in Black demonstration are simply targeting the settlers as "the bad guys".

The situation regarding settlers is complex. First of all, there are at least two kinds of settlers: those with ideological or religious motivations, and those with practical or economic motivations.

Historically, the first settlers had a religious and ideological motivation. But later, the government came with its own motivations, and offered cheap housing plans to settle Jews on land occupied since 1967 (Gaza, the West Bank, parts of Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and the Sinai (though the latter was later returned). So many Jews went to settle in these places simply because it was an attractive option. The majority of the settlers are therefore just ordinary Israelis. Those who live in the parts of occupied Jerusalem don't even see themselves as settlers, since these parts were annexed. Some of those who live in the Golan Heights say that they would be willing to give up their homes in the case that peace is established with Syria.

The point I am making is that settlers are not necessarily villains, and that it is the Israeli government that allowed them to be there, or put them there, which must be held responsible. I think that this would be the position of most of those who attend demonstrations against the occupation.

There are comparable situations regarding deliberate settlement of occupied territories in other places in the world, such as Tibet, Northern Cyprus and the Kuril Islands (northern islands of Japan).

For an interesting sidenote on the legal aspects of Israel's settlement policies, there is an article that discusses Road 443 - the road you traveled on when visiting Wissam in Beit Sira.

"Tyranny in Tar" (http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/948033.html)

Denise is a secretary of the mayor(?)

"Denise", like me, is working in the Communications and Development Office, mainly as a writer. Usually, she writes proposals, applications and reports for foundations and friends associations that support the village.

Best wishes,

I visited two Arab families. They treat their family and relatives so nice. Keiko in JVC explained that. They support each other because of the conflict. Sometimes they have lost a family member who used to support their family. A big family is good as they can support each other, even though they don't have enough people to provide support the family. They are helping each other.

I will go on this tour in march!
My friend, Shelly from the US (she is great!) booked a seat for me.

Tours to Hebron

For the past two years, Breaking the Silence has been giving guided tours to Hebron- a place where many of us have served as soldiers.

The purpose of the tour is to introduce our audiences to the complexities of the Occupation.

Route of the tour: Baruch Goldstein's burial site in Kiryat Arba, The Tomb of Patriarchs, a walk through Shuhada st. (including the five settlement areas and the wholesale market), and a visit to a Palestinian family in Tel Rumeida neighborhood.

The tours are in cooperation with the organization, "Bnei Avraham".

For further information, please contact :

silvana.hogg@gmx.ch

The next tour will be on: 22.02, 07.03, 28.03 It is possible to organize a private tour for groups. All tours are coordinated with the Israeli Police in Hebron

I saw this (Gaza protest) on the web with Howard. There were almost 50,000 people to protest the siege.

I also got an email from a Japanese girl who is interested in this area. She sounds young and had a lot of anger inside of her. I don’t think I can handle it. I just want to leave it.

It sometimes happens. People are speaking about 'peace’ but spread their anger into the world. We have to protest against injustice, unfairness and everything like what the Israeli government is doing now. But I don’t think it is a nice way to throw the anger at people who have different opinions.

She didn’t even check the meaning of what I really said. I am tired of it.

By the way, I got a nice email from Mr. A.. He is so nice. Did I write about that?

I am back from Bethlehem and Jerusalem now.

I went to a refugee camp last Friday. JVC(Japanese Volunteer Center) helps Palestinian women to have jobs and teaches them how to make things like bags, coin case, cushion cover, etc. They have extremely professional techniques in embroidery, so if they teach the women how to make a bag or something using a sewing machine, they can sell all of those things easily. It is very difficult to find a job for the people in refugee camps. Sometimes young girls work very hard to make money to go to university.

I will tell you all the stories of this place later. It was really nice to meet a family there.

My thought on peace-making

…From my experience, sometimes we have to face the difficulties of dealing with our feelings and emotions. Working with people in conflict zone requires many things like remaining calm, hearing their opinions, trying not to judge, having compassion, treating people with respect, sharing their stories, staying centered, finding exact meaning of a word, and so on. Probably, you will find some contradictions in these statements: It becomes very difficult if you have your opinion, but it would be much more difficult if you don't have one.

Also it was good for me to learn that I have to be careful in using words that "group individuals in one category" such as "Israelis do..." "Japanese are ..", "people here are like.." etc. I met many unnecessary emotional resistances from people by this kind of stereotyping comments. We need to be very careful when we say something if we really want to bring "peace" into the land. Some people are quite sensitive in this area, so we can easily hurt people not by guns, but by our words (by accident.) We must know what kind of language we are speaking, I don't mean "Hebrew" or "Arabic," but whether we are speaking "the language of the people in power" or those of the oppressed and without power. If we use the language of the people in power, it would not work very well even when we talk about peace. I think "violence" can take different forms. The violence that goes on here is not only physical violence, but cultural, economical and political violence. It is easy for me not to use the military weapons, but I can use the power of words and pens. It is still very difficult for me to find a peaceful, non-violent way (to express myself). Unfortunately, the people in power sometimes don't exactly know what kind of power they have and/or use, or they don't even realize they have power. I met a Japanese woman who has spent 5 years here (back and forth between Japan and here). She perfectly knows who she is. She knows what kind of "energy" she creates and how to bring it here. It is a bit complicated, I have no idea how to explain it, but probably someone else does.

Besides, there are hundreds ways to deal with the conflict and thousands of opinions as to how to make peace between the Jews and Arabs. We can't protest each method or choice even if it looks totally different from ours. Likewise, there are many ways to contribute to bring peace in this area, for example, one works as a volunteer in refugee camp, the other becomes a journalist or photographer while his/her friend is trying to be a mediator. Their approaches are very different. The mediator is expected to be centered, but the journalist can take one side. We usually don't judge or even decide which is better for the people here.

In order to overcome any shortcomings in finding out the best way for them, I am trying to look back to our history and find out who I am. This is my approach as a Japanese in studying conflict reconciliation or conflict transformation. This is only my point of view, but before I say something to the people and the soldiers in Israel, I have to see what we, the Japanese, did to the Asians during the WWII In contrast to Germany, we, our government, still refuse to apologize to China and Korea and other countries, as you know. In Israel, the textbook of Israeli history is not the same as what we are told. It sounds similar to what the Japanese government did as it erased the facts, like what happened in China and Korea, from our history. In my memories of school years, I couldn't find much about Nang King Genocide, 731 troops, Nakano School for Generals in my history textbook.

It is easy to put our issues aside and be here as a peace maker between Israel/Palestine. But how is it possible to make others try to reconcile with their enemies, when we can't make good friendship with neighbors because of our past?

That is why I thought it was 'not enough to blame the Israelis.' I really have to face these Japanese problems if I want to continue this challenge; it is kind of changing the world from the inside out. I know this is not your concern/problem, but is mine that I have to deal with.

Thank you for reading.

peace be upon you all,

Hi,

It is so hard to accept things happening here. I hear the sounds of jets every 2 minutes, probably going to Gaza.

On the contrary, we don't have any bombing here, as you know. I went to Haifa (northern part of Israel) yesterday to attend a funeral. I met a nice woman who came from the U.S., who also spent several years in Mexico. She is a resident of nswas (Daria’s good friend), and her mother passed away a few days ago.

Daria and Rucy, another friend of Daria and who now become my friend, took me to the city of Haifa. It is an old city and has history. We enjoyed walking down in an Arab town. It was beautiful and people were so nice.

I had a very bad experience in Jerusalem from a tour guide. It is also my fault, but I don't think he was a good man. I almost wanted to stay away from all Arab people because of him. But I tried to use the bad memory in a good way. It took a couple of weeks. Now I am OK with everyone.

Anyway, it was nice to visit Haifa.
However, it is still hard to enjoy anything during a time like this.

My friend had a hard time in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. It is related to the things that are happening here. Some of the volunteers tried to extend their visa, but was denied. It took a few more days to get the 'volunteer visa.'

I think I'd better go and write every experience in Japanese as well.

cheers,
kiriko

…I just want to tell you something about the activities here. I asked if it was OK or not to attend some demonstrations.

It is not safe to take part in some activities here even when there are many Jewish people within the group. A few years ago, a policemen shot at the people who were peacefully walking down the street and killed 13 people there. Also, last month, a Japanese tourist attended a demonstration and got attacked in his eyes and he is in danger of becoming blind.

It is not only about the risk to me, but about bringing the risks to Palestinians. JVC member (Keiko-san) in Jerusalem said there are many different ways if we want to bring peace to the land. It is OK to demonstrate in my country, but not here.

Things are not easy here...

Well, we will see....

…about Kiriko’s ‘bad experience’ in Jerusalem…

I don't think it is uninteresting, but it is not just his fault. He was not a good man, but I learned about my weakness from him. He was a guide of Old City in Jerusalem. I didn't ask him to guide, but he followed me and started to guide. After few minutes, I realized he was a guide but I didn't stop him. Then, he asked for 6600 yen ($66) for providing 20minutes of tour guide around the area. The place he asked for money was in a dark basement. I was so scared and wanted to go out because there was no one except us. I paid the fee and asked him if he was a Christian because the place he guided me through was a place where Jesus was taken. He wasn't a Christian, but a Muslim. I was disappointed when I found out about it. That's all.

I am OK with Arab people except for this memory. I know this is my weakness. That is why it is so painful for me. I am trying to accept my weakness but it is still difficult. It wasn't his fault even though he wasn't a good man.

bless him.

Obama's Presidency: A Political and Moral Disappointment

It's all over town. Only the Obama administration does not want to hear it. The people responsible for the moral decay of U.S. foreign policy were the 'Bush-worriers': Vice President Dick Cheney and his President George W. Bush and all the other cronies. Why will Eric Holder investigate the poor CIA subordinates who just followed orders? The torture memos and all the other unconstitutional and partly criminal orders went all the way down the chain of command. The White House people were a gathering of political tricksters. The U.S. has no moral authority anymore, despite Obama, because his foreign policy has only been slightly different from his predecessor’s. Anti-American militancy in the Third World has not diminished. Why should it? Has Obama done something fundamentally different from Bush despite making nice speeches in order to camouflage the ongoing brutality of America’s occupation in Iraq and Afghanistan? Baghram and all other military camps, including Guantanamo, are still operated as extra-judicial zones. Is not the U.S. a law-abiding country? Or does the rule of law only apply to Americans and not to the “Wretched of the Earth” in American “colonies”? Obama has not committed the U. S. plausibly to democratic values and human rights so far because he has been ignoring the infamous Bush presidency. He has to make a clear cut.

In his novel “Why the Dreyfus Affair matters” Louis Begley draws comparisons between the handling of the “Dreyfus Affair” and the terror suspects in Guantanamo. In both cases there has been an abuse of power. For Begely, who survived the holocaust in Poland, the Bush presidency followed with its systematic torture of detainees “the footsteps of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union”. Perhaps this and similar comparisons are exaggerated but the misuse of the rule of law under President Bush and his cronies should concern the American public. The corrupted moral authority of the U.S. can only credibly restored through a solid refurbishment of the Bush years, followed by an indictment of those who were responsible.

President Obama must furthermore distance himself from the dangerous neoconservative concept of perpetual war against Muslims in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran. How come that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admitted that the U.S. was behind the “riots” and “protests” in Iran? And what about Obama? Who is in charge of American foreign policy? Hillary is merely Obama's secretary for foreign affairs. There is no Iranian “threat” to the national security of the United States and it has never been. Iran’s military spending is less than one percent of that of the United States. In real figures: U.S. military spending stands now at 623 billion dollars a year; the rest of the world put together 500 billion and Iran the “staggering” amount of some 4 billion dollars. Who then threatens world peace?

The famous American political scientists John Mearsheimer and Stephan M. Walt stated in their groundbreaking book “The Israel Lobby” that Israel is no longer an asset for US foreign policy interests in the Middle East but rather a liability. The Obama administration has to define its strategic interests according to its national security interests. Israel’s permanent violation of international law and the human rights of the Palestinians should definitely not be in the American interest. America’s bad reputation and problems in the Middle East have a lot to do with Israel’s occupation policy. The independence of the United States emerged out of an anti-colonial revolt against European colonialism. According to this anti-colonial heritage the U.S. should never accept the ongoing occupation und subjugation of another people by a democratic ally. Such an occupation not only corrupts the occupier but also hurts the credibility of the West and its values in the Muslim world and beyond.

Why has Obama accomplished so little in the Middle East so far? His alleged “anti-Israeli” rhetoric concerning a total halt of Israel’s illegal settlement extentions in the Palestinian Occupied Territories is going to be watered down by Israel. There is a “compromise” in sight. The U. S. is going to make another phony compromise where compliance with international law would be required.

Why is Obama acting like he does? Obama is a “prisoner” of the American power elite and their corporate interests. He has to act according to certain rules to guarantee the military, imperial and global might of the U. S. Therefore he was elected. The only instrument left to get its way is America´s military power. Financially, economically and morally the U. S. is bankrupt. Not all the Arab countries have apprehended these weaknesses yet, especially the Saudis. They have presented their Middle East peace plan twice and got no positive answer neither from Israel nor from the U. S. They should think about changing sides despite Obama´s Cairo speech.

The &quot;Israeli Lobby&quot; Strikes Again

The Norwegian Nobel Committee has chosen to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 1984 to Bishop Desmond Tutu, General Secretary of the South African Council of Churches.

The Committee has attached importance to Desmond Tutu's role as a unifying leader figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa. The means by which this campaign is conducted is of vital importance for the whole of the continent of Africa and for the cause of peace in the world. Through the award of this year's Peace Prize, the Committee wishes to direct attention to the non-violent struggle for liberation to which Desmond Tutu belongs, a struggle in which black and white South Africans unite to bring their country out of conflict and crisis.

South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu has accused Israel of practising apartheid in its policies towards the Palestinians. The Nobel peace laureate said he was &amp;quot;very deeply distressed&amp;quot; by a visit to the Holy Land, adding that &amp;quot;it reminded me so much of what happened to us black people in South Africa.&amp;quot;

Left : Archbishop Desmond Tutu said 'oppression' would not bring security

The Jewish lobby is powerful - very powerful. Well, so what?

Archbishop Desmond Tutu in a speech in the United States, carried in the UK's Guardian newspaper, Archbishop Tutu said he saw &amp;quot;the humiliation of the Palestinians at checkpoints and roadblocks, suffering like us when young white police officers prevented us from moving about.&amp;quot;

The archbishop, who was a leading opponent of apartheid in South Africa, said Israel would &amp;quot;never get true security and safety through oppressing another people.&amp;quot; Archbishop Tutu said his criticism of the Israeli Government did not mean he was anti-Semitic. &amp;quot;I am not even anti-white, despite the madness of that group,&amp;quot; he said.

Left : Israeli checkpoint in the occupied territories

The Jewish lobby

The archbishop attacked the political power of Jewish groups in the United States, saying: &amp;quot;People are scared in this country, to say wrong is wrong because the Jewish lobby is powerful - very powerful. Well, so what? &amp;quot;The apartheid government was very powerful, but today it no longer exists.&amp;quot;

Archbishop Tutu said Israeli checkpoints were humiliating Palestinians. He went on to point out, &amp;quot;Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Pinochet, Milosevic, and Idi Amin were all powerful, but in the end they bit the dust.&amp;quot;

Speaking at a conference called Ending the Oppression in Boston, Archbishop Tutu told delegates Jewish people had been at the forefront of the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. He asked: &amp;quot;Have our Jewish sisters and brothers forgotten their humiliation? Have they forgotten the collective punishment, the home demolitions, in their own history so soon? Have they turned their backs on their profound and noble religious traditions? Have they forgotten that God cares deeply about the downtrodden?&amp;quot;

Left : The White government enforced apartheid ruthlessly. Large areas of Cape Town were designated 'white suburbs' and colored and black communities were forced to leave and settle on the Cape Flats.

Black people had to carry a pass giving them permission to stay in Cape Town and were forced to leave if they were not in work. The government closed down mission schools and excluded blacks from advanced education.

The archbishop said that while he condemned suicide bombings by Palestinian militants against Israel, Israeli military action would not bring security to the Jewish state. Israel must &amp;quot;strive for peace based on justice, based on withdrawal from all the occupied territories, and the establishment of a viable Palestinian state on those territories side by side with Israel, both with secure borders,&amp;quot; he said.

Put off by his criticism of Israeli policy, the University of St. Thomas snubs Nobel Laureate

Back in April, when University of St. Thomas staffer Mike Klein informed his colleagues in the Justice and Peace Studies program that he'd succeeded in booking Archbishop Desmond Tutu for a campus appearance, the faculty buzzed in anticipation. For a program dedicated to fostering social change and nonviolence, there were few figures who embodied that vision more aptly than the world-renowned civil rights activist and Nobel Laureate.

Tutu's appearance—slated for the spring of '08—was made possible by the university's partnership with PeaceJam International, a youth-centered project that taps Nobel Laureates to teach young adults about peace and justice. For four straight years, the Catholic university's St. Paul campus had played host to PeaceJam festivities featuring Nobel Peace Prize winners such as Rigoberta Menchú Tum and Shirin Ebadi.

But in a move that still has faculty members shaking their heads in disbelief, St. Thomas administrators—concerned that Tutu's appearance might offend local Jews—told organizers that a visit from the archbishop was out of the question.

&amp;quot;We had heard some things he said that some people judged to be anti-Semitic and against Israeli policy,&amp;quot; says Doug Hennes, St. Thomas's vice president for university and government relations. &amp;quot;We're not saying he's anti-Semitic. But he's compared the state of Israel to Hitler and our feeling was that making moral equivalencies like that are hurtful to some members of the Jewish community.&amp;quot;

St. Thomas officials made this inference after Hennes talked to Julie Swiler, a spokeswoman for the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas.

&amp;quot;I told him that I'd run across some statements that were of concern to me,&amp;quot; says Swiler. &amp;quot;In a 2002 speech in Boston, he made some comments that were especially hurtful.&amp;quot;

During that speech, titled &amp;quot;Occupation Is Oppression,&amp;quot; Tutu lambasted the Israeli government for its treatment of Palestinians in occupied territories. While a transcription clearly suggests his criticism was aimed at the Israeli government (&amp;quot;We don't criticize the Jewish people,&amp;quot; he said during the speech. &amp;quot;We criticize, we will criticize when they need to be criticized, the government of Israel&amp;quot;), pro-Israeli organizations such as the Zionist Organization of America went on the offensive and protested campus appearances by Tutu, accusing him of anti-Semitism.

Hennes says the input officials received from &amp;quot;the Jewish community&amp;quot; in this case was confined to Swiler and a few rabbis teaching within St. Thomas's Center for Jewish-Christian Learning. &amp;quot;I think there's a consensus in the Jewish community that his words were offensive,&amp;quot; Swiler reiterates.

That was news to Marv Davidov, an adjunct professor within the Justice and Peace Studies program.

Left : Is this the face of anti-Semitism? The University of St. Thomas seems to think so

&amp;quot;As a Jew who experienced real anti-Semitism as a child, I'm deeply disturbed that a man like Tutu could be labeled anti-Semitic and silenced like this,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;I deeply resent the Israeli lobby trying to silence any criticism of its policy. It does a great disservice to Israel and to all Jews.&amp;quot;

The controversy didn't end there. Incensed at the administration's decision, Professor Cris Toffolo—chair of the Justice and Peace Studies program at the time—sent Tutu a letter on May 24 informing him of the administration's decision. She also indicated her disagreement with the move and warned Tutu that he might be in for a smear campaign.

University brass caught wind of the letter, and on August 1, Tom Rochon, executive vice president of academic affairs, sent a letter of his own to Toffolo informing her that St. Thomas administrators had decided to revoke her position as chair of the Justice and Peace Studies program.

Asked about the reasoning behind the demotion, Rochon and Hennes decline to comment. Toffolo herself is hesitant to offer any statements about it due to the sensitivity of her situation, though she did confirm that her letter to Tutu was the catalyst for her demotion.

&amp;quot;This is pure bullshit,&amp;quot; says Davidov. &amp;quot;As far as fighting for civil rights, I consider Tutu to be my brother. And I consider Cris Toffolo to be my sister. They're messing with my family here. If Columbia permits a Holocaust denier [Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad] to speak at their university, why are St. Thomas officials refusing to let Tutu, an apostle of nonviolence, speak at ours?&amp;quot;

Davidov and other professors maintain that the situation at St. Thomas is emblematic of a larger issue. &amp;quot;What happened at the University of St. Thomas is not an isolated event,&amp;quot; says Toffolo. &amp;quot;Until we have an honest debate about U.S. policy related to Israel, and about Israeli policy in the Occupied Territories, the spiral of violence will continue.&amp;quot;

Arming Terrorist Israel
Dr. Elias Akleh

March 11, 2009

Since their occupation of Palestine in 1948 to establish illegal Israel in the heart of the Arab World until the present, Zionist Israelis had initiated seven wars against their Arab neighbors. Six of those were waged after 1967 to maintain their occupation of the rest of Palestine, Lebanese Sheb'a Farms, and Syrian Golan Heights; formally recognized by the international community as an occupation.

Israel had maintained its occupation of the land for the last sixty years. The question that poses itself, here, is how a small state like Israel, 7 million Zionist Jews in an area of 8 thousand square miles (excluding the 1967 occupied territories), could maintain such an occupation against hundreds of millions of Arabs and against the disapproval of the civic (not political) international community? Bullying with extreme brutal force is the answer. Israel is a military society with every Zionist Israeli citizen, from childhood to old age, being militaristic in one form or another. Israel possesses all kinds of weapons including weapons of mass destruction (WMD) such as nuclear and chemical weapons.

Israel did not become the fourth largest army in the world by its own merit, but by the Western countries supplying it with all kinds of weapons. In its February 23 rd report "Foreign Arms Supplies To Israel/Gaza Fueling Conflict" amnestyusa.org named 18 EU member states, which authorized 1,018 arms export licenses to Israel worth a little less than 200 million Euros. All these arms exports are in violation of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports under Criterion 2, which states that member states are supposed to "deny an export license if there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression or be used in the commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law" . Israel had committed such violations throughout its entire existence.

France, Germany, and Romania were the top three arms suppliers to Israel worth of 126 million Euros, 28 million Euros, and 17 million Euros respectively. Other significant arms suppliers to Israel since 2001 also include alphabetically Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Brazil, Columbia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, India, Italy, Poland, Romania, Serbia-Montenegro, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, and UK.

The report also indicated the well-known fact that "Since 2001, the USA has been by far the major supplier of conventional arms to Israel" It also stated the logical conclusion that "Put simply, Israel's military intervention in the Gaza Strip has been equipped to a large extent by US-supplied weapons, munitions and military equipment paid for with US taxpayers' money" What the report failed to indicate is that Israel had violated all the US laws governing arms transfers.

Examining the American military aid to Israel we find that since the end of WWII Israel had been the largest recipient of US aid (Armed & Dangerous Report ). From 1949-2007 Israel had received more than $101 billion in total US economic and military aid. A previous Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two countries started phasing out the economic aid and increasing the military aid, and in 2008 all US aid to Israel turned into military aid only. The current MOU, singed by Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns in August 2007, has increased military aid to Israel by 25% a year for the next ten years FY2009-2018, totaling to $30 billion.

During the Bush administration 2001-2007 American military aid to Israel came under three primary programs; Foreign Military Sales (FMS) ran through the Pentagon totaled $25.2 billion in arms sales and contracts, Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) ran through the States Department totaled $6.16 billion in weapons and equipment, and Excess Defense Articles (EDA) also ran through the Pentagon totaled $36 million in used weapons and equipment. The total comes to a little more than $31.4 billion.

The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) provided Israel with air, missile & munitions, naval, design, vehicles, and miscellaneous military aid. Israel received $19.81 billion for their air forces that included F-35 joint strike fighters, C-130J-30 aircrafts, JP-8 aviation jet fuel, and T-6A Texan aircrafts. In missiles and munitions Israel received $2.73 billion worth of GBU-28 & 39 small diameter bombs, TOW, Hellfire, bunker buster munitions, AMRAAM, Harpoon, Sidewinder, JDAM's, and MK-80 series. US gave Israel $1.9 billion worth of the new series (Littoral) naval combat ships, $164 million worth of troop carrier armored vehicles and trucks, and $253 million worth of miscellaneous in the form of Patriot Missiles upgrade and M72A7 Light Anti-Armor weapons. Also included in this FMS package were $350 million worth of design and construction of two infantry bases.

The Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) program contained about three hundred different categories of weapons transfer to Israel. The main top ten categories for FY2001-2006 were $557,896 million in aircraft spare parts, $449 million in missile spare parts, $439 million in engine jet F-100 spare parts, $254 million in engine jet F-100 series (F-15 & F-16), $210 million in ship components and spare parts, $186 million in aircraft fighter F-15 spare parts, $163 million in electronics components and spare parts, $128 million in ammunition raw materials, and $120 million in training equipment.

The Excess Defense Articles (EDC) program shipped to Israel $36 million worth of used Cobra Helicopters, personnel carriers, carrier command posts, and miscellaneous articles.

The most outrageous American military aid to Israel is the billions of Dollars worth of refined fuel to the Israeli army. Israel's own oil refineries in Haifa and Ashdod, which could supply Israeli military with all its fuel needs, are instead producing and selling its refined products on the open market. The Israeli army gets all its military fuel from the USA through the FMS program. The US Defense Department uses American tax money to buy oil crude from Arab Gulf States, ship it to American refineries to refine it, and then ship it to Israel.

According to documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, from 2004 to 2008 the Bush administration had granted the Israeli army 500 million gallons of oil products worth $1.1 billion. During this period the American tax payers were faced with energy crises and had to pay $4 per gallon of gas at the pump while Israel was getting free gas from the Bush administration. Somebody has to pay for this gas, and it wasn't the Israelis.

Moreover, the US provides loan guarantees to Israel so that Israel can take out loans in the international money market with lower interest rates, and if Israel happens to default on any of these loans the US will bail Israel out with American tax money similar to the latest $700 billion bailout for the American banks. There is a condition on these loan guarantees. It states that these loans can only be used to support the activities within the sovereign areas in Israel (pre-1967 war), and cannot be used in the occupied Palestinian territories. This is a facetiously misleading condition, since such loans can free other monies in the Israeli budget to be used in building illegal colonies (settlements) in the occupied territories.

The US has three laws that govern arms transfer to other countries. The first is the Arms Export Control Act (P.L.80-829). This law states that American weapons given or sold to any foreign country can be used only for legitimate self-defense or for internal security. They are not to be used in occupational operations.

The second is the Foreign Assistance Act (P.L.97-195), which states that any country is not illegible for any form of US aid if it engages in consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights. The third is the Leahy Law (Foreign Ops Appropriations Act). This is an annual part of the Foreign Appropriations Act, and states that no aid will be given to any unit of the security forces of a foreign country if the Secretary of State has credible evidence that such unit has committed gross violations of human rights. Expanding their occupation of the land the Israelis had violated numerous UN Resolutions, broke international laws as well as their own local laws, violated all human rights, committed grave war crimes, and perpetrated terrorism against Arabs in general and Palestinian Arabs in specific.

It has been, numerously, documented by Israeli, Palestinian, and international NGOs that Israel had consistently violated international laws and human rights since 1948. In all its seven wars Israel, contrary to the false Israeli/American propaganda, had initiated the conflict in one way or another. Israel had attacked all its neighbors, committed war crimes, and occupied parts of their land. The Israelis had evicted hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of their country, completely wiped off many Palestinian towns and built Israeli colonies in their place, had stolen Palestinian farm land and forcefully controlled the economy. Israel had shoved thousands of Palestinian leaders and freedom fighters into prisons, and kept the rest of the Palestinian populations confined into open air virtual town-prisons within a separation wall.

Attacking Palestinian civilians, mainly defenseless children and women, has become the daily entertainment of Israeli government -backed and armed extreme Zionist colonizing terrorists (settlers?). Israeli soldiers developed the sport of hunting (shooting) Palestinian children on their way to schools or while playing in front of their homes. The Israeli army is using the 1967 occupied Palestinian territories and its Palestinian inhabitants as testing fields and subjects for theirs and for the American newly developed weapons as was exhibited in Israel's latest 22-days onslaught and massacres in Gaza.

Successive Israeli governments had consistently sent their armies to massacre Palestinian civilians. Israeli army had used all types of American supplied weapons; including depleted uranium tipped bombs and missiles, DIME bombs, chemical weapons such as phosphorous bombs and conventional weapons, to specifically and deliberately target Palestinian children and women. We need only go back to the Israeli last two wars; July 2006 against Lebanon and December 2008 against Gaza, still fresh in memory, to witness clear evidence of Israel's terrorism, war crimes, disrespect and contempt of international laws and human rights.

The driving force for the Zionist Israeli crimes and terrorism has been the extreme racist religious ideology of establishing a pure theocratic "Jewish" state for a prejudice- god's chosen people "narcissist Zionist Jews" in the real-estate- brokering-god's promised land of Greater Israel "Eretz Israel" extending from Nile to Euphrates. This theocratic dream necessitates a holy war (not the first one against the Middle East) to evict and remove the original inhabitants of the land to make living space for world Jewry to come and live in this Promised Land. This is how Israelis perceive their "final solution" to their "Palestinian problem"; destruction, massacres and mass evictions.

Although Israel has violated all EU and US arms transfer laws yet none had conducted any investigation to hold Israel accountable to these laws. The two rare incidents when under pressure the American State Department investigated Israeli violations where completely suppressed and quashed. The first was in 2002 when Israel dropped a one-ton bomb on an apartment building in Gaza City in order to extra-judicially assassinate a Hamas leader, Salah Shehadeh, and killed 14 other civilians, women and children, in the process. This investigation was quashed by none other than John Bolton, the Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security at the time. The investigation was never sent to the Congress in violation of US laws.

The second investigation was in 2006 when Israel dropped an estimated one million cluster bombs on the civilian areas of South Lebanon in the last 72 hours of the war, even after a seize-fire was agreed upon. This was made a top secret State Department investigation and was released to only a few senior members of the Cogress such as the Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and "Zionist" Joe Biden, the present Vice President. Needless to say that this investigation had never came to light.

Israel is a terrorist entity without any specific borders. It is an expansionist colonizing regime. Its successive governments had disregarded all UN resolutions, broken international laws, violated all human rights, committed holocaustal-level genocides, and perpetrated war crimes against all its neighbors and against mother earth and against the environment.

Yet the Western political power elites justify Israeli terror as a self-defense, and keep transfering more devastating arms to this terrorist entity to wage more future wars and to wreck more havoc in the Arab World. They also distort facts and describe the victims of the Israeli terror, the Palestinians, as terrorists, deny them their legitimate right to bear arms for self-defense, and send their naval war machines and serveillance equipment to tighten the illegal Israeli blockade against Gaza Strip under the guise of preventing "arms smuggling", while at the same time shedding some crockodile tears and call for humanitarian aid to Gaza's Palestinians.

To the Arabs of the Middle East, Israel seems to be a military tool for the Western countries. Hatred towards these Western political regimes is the natural consequences of arming Israel. Should we keep asking "why do they hate us" any more?

End Silence on Terrorists’ Endangering of Civilians, AJCongress Demands of the International Red Cross - 16 August 2006

The American Jewish Congress is demanding that the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) criticize Hezbollah’s positioning military assets in densely populated civilian areas. “If the International Committee of the Red Cross wants to effectively protect civilians, it will address this problem, beginning now,” said Jack Rosen, American Jewish Congress President. “If it does not, it should give up the pretense of being a disinterested arbiter of international humanitarian law.”

When an arm of the world's leading terrorist state issues warnings to the Red Cross about Lebanon in ominous tones, it means that Apartheid Israel is about to go off on another rampage against Lebanon.

Still stuck in the midst of a 5 year drought, Israel is getting desperate to fill swimming pools and keep lawns watered. Having already stolen the Golan Heights springs from Syria, the Shaaba Farms springs from Lebanon and most of the decent wells and aquifers from Occupied Palestine, Israel is now hungrily eyeing Lebanon's River Litani.

Which means that Israel, a nation of soulless land thieves, racists, assassins, con artists, murderers, false-flag experts and bigots will do what it always does.... Invade, Murder, Occupy and Steal.

Infectious Diseases and Travel Clinic, Bnai ion Medical Centre, Haifa, Israel.

BACKGROUND: Drug abuse constitutes a major sociomedical problem throughout the world. A unique subgroup with a higher potential of drug abuse are young travelers to Southeast Asia.

Less than a handful of studies have focused on this population, and even fewer have been carried out on site. Our aim was to characterize the phenomenon of drug abuse among Israelis and other nationals, and to define risk factors that would predict which travelers are prone to abusing drugs.

METHODS: Data was collected through questionnaires that were distributed in Southeast Asia to 430 travelers. Medical students administered the questionnaires across India, Thailand, Nepal, Vietnam, and Laos during 2002 and 2003.

RESULTS: Questionnaires from 231 Israelis and 199 other nationals (mostly from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Australia, and Germany) were analyzed. These travelers had a mean age of 25.3 years. We found that 54.3% of the travelers abused drugs during the trip.

Israelis (66.2%) abused drugs more frequently than did non-Israelis (40.7%, p < .001).

Males abused drugs significantly more than females did, as did secular more than religious people; however, those with an academic degree abused drugs less than others.

For 23.5% of the Israelis, the trip was their first encounter with drugs. Of the entire cohort, 72% abused cannabis products, and most of them (49.6%) did it on daily basis. The use of "hard" drugs (eg, lysergic acid diethylamide) was more common among non-Israelis than among the Israelis (37% and 20%, respectively; p < .006).

Much higher rates of drug abuse (70.1%) were found in India than in other Southeast Asian countries.

Logistic regression identified that prior use of drugs, Israeli nationality, travel to India, cigarette smoking, and traveling alone were significant predictors of drug abuse.

CONCLUSIONS: There is a disturbingly high rate of drug abuse in travelers to certain Southeast Asian countries, both among Israeli and other nationals. For many youngsters, this is their first encounter with drugs, and many plan to continue abusing drugs upon their repatriation. Travelers to Southeast Asia should be a major target group for primary, preventive, antidrug campaigns worldwide.

Unless President Barack Obama resolves to expunge 'special' from the U.S.-Israeli 'special relationship,' this entangled alliance will continue to ensure that the U.S. is portrayed as guilty by its association with Tel Aviv's thuggish behavior in Palestine and elsewhere. And by the U.S. insistence that Israel not be held accountable under international law.

On July 3rd, Israeli ambassador Michael Oren claimed “Iran nuke could wipe Israel off the map in seconds.” An accurate translation reveals that what the president of Iran proposes is that Zionism be “erased from the pages of history.” But why quibble over words and their intent when Israel’s intent is to create a consensus that ensures war with Iran?

Two days after Oren’s saber-rattling speech, Vice-President Joe Biden was asked in a televised interview whether the Obama Administration would restrain Israeli military action against Iran. President Obama was then out of the country. A self-proclaimed Zionist, Biden responded , “Israel can determine for itself—it’s a sovereign nation—what’s in their interest and what they decide to do relative to Iran and anyone else.”

Unfamiliar with the refrain, “loose lips sink ships,” Biden’s cavalier comment evoked memories of Vice President Dick Cheney who routinely waited until his boss was out of town to make bellicose remarks that moved the U.S. steadily closer to war in Iraq.

Admiral Michael Mullen, chairman of the Pentagon’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, scrambled to offset the impression left by Biden’s comment. Astute strategists know it is the small impressions that, step-by-step, form the consensus beliefs that shape policy-making. It was the gradual drip, drip, drip of such impressions that created the (false) consensus belief that Iraq had WMD, ties to Al Qaeda and mobile biological weapons laboratories.

Pro-Israeli pundits quickly claimed that, with Biden’s comment, Washington had given Tel Aviv the green light to attack Iran. Mullen grabbed media attention to reconfirm the obvious: an attack on Iran could have “grave and unpredictable consequences.”

Arrogant, Aggressive & Above the Law

What has Israel done to quell these global jitters? Tel Aviv ordered a long-range Air Force exercise covering the same distance as from Israel to Iran. It dispatched through the Suez Canal a Dolphin class submarine, three of which are widely believed capable of launching a nuclear missile attack. And it sent a “message” to Iran by sailing two Saar class missile ships through the canal into the Red Sea, putting them within striking distance of Tehran.

Meanwhile, Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News played its usual supporting role by announcing Israeli Navy Prepares for Potential Attack on Iran's Nuclear Facilities. To date, Barack Obama has shown little inclination to say no to Tel Aviv and show he means it. Instead, his administration has staffed up with advisers who are disproportionately pro-Israeli—more so even than the Bush and Clinton presidencies.

When in February he failed to support the nomination of Ambassador Charles Freeman as Director of the National Intelligence Council, Obama served global notice of just how much influence Israel wields over U.S. foreign policy. Opposition to Freeman was led by Steven Rosen, a former executive of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Though you would never know it from reports in mainstream media, Rosen had been indicted under the Espionage Act for transferring to the Israeli embassy classified Pentagon intelligence on Iran.

Adding insult to the Freeman injury, Obama Attorney General Eric Holder approved the withdrawal of charges against Rosen and co-conspirator Keith Weissman, another AIPAC executive. After receiving a 12-year sentence for conceding his complicity, Pentagon Iran analyst Lawrence Franklin saw his sentence reduced to time served under house arrest and was ordered to perform 100 hours of community service. So much for accountability.

Just as he said not a word on Gaza, Obama remained silent on Freeman. Left to twist in the wind by the commander in chief, Freeman withdrew his nomination. When he vowed not to remain silent in his critique of the Israel lobby, Washington Post editors denied there was such a lobby, dismissed his critique as a “conspiracy theory” and attacked his comments as a “crackpot tirade.”

Though AIPAC avowed it took no stand on the appointment, reports confirm it leaned on key senators and later boasted that Obama was a “pushover.” In a fiery rejoinder to his critics, Freeman noted, “This is not just a tragedy for Israelis and their neighbors in the Middle East; it is doing widening damage to the national security of the United States.”

Palestinians are correct to wonder how Americans could be so unresponsive to their abuse at the hands of a U.S. ally. What those in the Middle East fail to grasp is that Americans do not know. How could they? Mainstream media is dominated by pro-Israelis and the Israel lobby politically dominates U.S. foreign policy in the region.

Freeman was correct in the mid-1990s when he described the lobby’s “virtual hammerlock on American foreign policy.” The only difference now is that Israeli influence has grown far more systemic. An admirer of Israel, Freeman cautions: “Right now it is doing itself in and taking us with it.” By seeking to induce the U.S. to wage war in Iran, Tel Aviv confirms its agenda has little to do with U.S. interests and everything to do with its expansionist goals for the region.

Self-censorship in both politics and media precludes Americans from knowing the perils that accompany the U.S.-Israeli relationship. Nor do Americans know the horrors that this alliance has imposed on Palestinians. Activist Alison Weir dedicated an aptly named website to educating Americans: If Americans Knew .

Those who know are rarities. Those who know and criticize Israeli policy are routinely smeared with the toxic charge of anti-Semitism. Following Israel’s assault on Gaza, a high profile intimidation campaign against an academic critic at the University of California worked its intended silencing effect on academic critics nationwide.

The behavior of this extremist nationalist enclave thrives in darkness, a condition that aptly describes U.S. media coverage of conditions in Palestine. Steadily more Americans are working to make Israel’s thuggish conduct transparent but the numbers are few and the challenges great.

The U.S. is branded abroad as a nation governed on the basis of informed consent. Yet pro-Israelis maintain a virtual lockdown on information and debate on Israel. The fight for Palestine must be waged and won in the U.S. where the appeasement of Israel relies on a lack of knowledge. If Americans knew, their support would be withdrawn. The U.S.-Israeli relationship will remain “special” only so long as Zionism can continue to operate in the shadows.

Left : US troops stationed in the Horn of Africa - the US has increased its military interests in Africa

Discussion of the need for an Africa Command began long before the Bush administration. Bill Clinton’s military people talked about it too. But the question is whether this development will be a good thing for the continent .

The US has launched a new command centre for military operations in Africa, in a sign of a clear increase in forcing American interest in Africa. Known as Africom, the initiative was first announced in February and will be based initially in Stuttgart, Germany. Until now responsibility for Africa has been divided among the US military's European, Central and Pacific commands. The Pentagon says Africom will allow the US to have a more integrated and effective approach to the continent.

This is a significant re-ordering of the US military, and an increased interest that can be explained in the concept of resources including oil, its attenuated terrorism paradigm and the instability it breeds in an obfuscation of security; i.e., resource security.

The US now gets over 10% of its oil from Africa and is concerned about competition from China. Nevertheless, the Pentagon and State department are being careful to stress the aim of the new command is to help struggling states through training and aid, and not to launch new wars.

They point out that over one-third of approximately 400 or so staff will be diplomats and aid specialists rather than uniformed military. The initiative has received mixed reviews in the US.
Though many analysts welcome it as an opportunity for a more intense and unified approach to Africa, others warn of what they see as the danger of the militarization of US policy towards the continent. In Africa itself the response has been guarded.

Left : Proliferation of arms instead of an arm of liberation
The administration is mostly trying to define AFRICOM by what it is not. Theresa Whelan, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for African Affairs, says:

“Africa Command is not going to reflect a U.S. intent to engage kinetically in Africa. This is about prevention. This is not about fighting wars.” At another point, Whelan also said “This is not about a scramble for the continent.”

Left : The conquest for resources a nation building tradition

“We are not at war in Africa. Nor do we expect to be at war in Africa. Our embassies and AFRICOM will work in concert to keep it that way,” notes Jendayi Frazer, Assistant Secretary of State for Africa.

Despite these reassurances, many African nations view this move with a healthy dose of skepticism. They are expressing this view by shutting their doors. AFRICOM is temporarily based in Germany, but commanders hope to make the move to the region by fall 2008. The military seems to be favoring a “lily pad” approach of small bases across West Africa and the Horn region so as to not commit significant troops or lend credence to African concerns of a U.S. occupation. But where are these lily pads going to go?

Zambia has said no. In early September, President Levy Mwanawasa said that within the Southern African Development Community (a network of fourteen nations) “none of us is interested” in hosting the command. The South Africa Defense Minister Mosiuoa Lekota has refused to meet with U.S. General William “Kip” Ward, who will command AFRICOM. Lekota said recently, “Africa has to avoid the presence of foreign forces on her soil.”

Left : Boots and Coots

But, some countries are viewing AFRICOM as an opportunity. The United States has already secured access agreements with Senegal, Mali, Ghana, Gabon and Namibia. And the United States’ close ally Liberia has aggressively promoted of the Command. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf penned a widely cited and circulated op-ed for AllAfrica.Com that hyped the Command as an opportunity for African nations. She has lobbied hard for AFRICOM to come to Liberia.

The Africom charter specifies that the new command will focus on conflict prevention, rather than intervention. It will work with African states and regional organizations, such as the African Union and Ecowas, in coordination with other donor countries, to improve security capabilities and promote military professionalism and accountable governance.

Speaking in July 2007, at a reception marking the 231st Independence Anniversary of the United States, President Sirleaf said &amp;quot;Liberia, the U.S. historic ally, has stood resolutely with the United States, through good times and bad, and is offering its territory as it has done in the past, for the establishment of AFRICOM headquarters.&amp;quot;

The United States is also looking at Sao Tome and Principe, Equatorial Guinea, Kenya, Djibouti, and Ethiopia as possible locations.

In case none of these options work out, the Navy has a novel (and very expensive) idea to forgo land completely and house AFRICOM on a high-tech joint command and control ship that would circumnavigate the region.

Left : security for oil security

Although the US has been strengthening its security ties with a number of African nations over the last few years many are cautious about being seen to embrace the Americans too warmly - at least in public. That is one reason, perhaps, why the Pentagon has yet to find an African country to host the headquarters for AFRICOM, despite a considerable amount of shopping around.

Therefore, the U.S. is marketing the renewed impetus in Africa as a benevolent project to civilize and embellish the natives. Of course if one “gives a man a fish, he’ll eat for a day, teach him how to fish and he’ll eat forever.” But, what happens when you give a man weapons and military training? Djibouti, Ethiopian, Ugandan and Kenyan armed forces, among others, have been furnished by the U.S. military.

Left : Screening for oil

Africa is viewed as the third front of the war on terrorism. As Rear Admiral Richard Hunt, the Commander of Combined Joint Taskforce-Horn of Africa (or CJT-HOA, explains: “Africa is the new frontier that we need to engage now, or we are going to end up doing it later in a very negative way.”

As part of the CJT-HOA these soldiers are also building schools, digging wells and sanitizing slaughterhouses. Their work is delineated by the four Ps and the three Ds: Prevent conflict, promote regional stability, protect coalition interests and prevail against extremism in East Africa and Yemen through diplomacy, development and defense.

Left : Oil Scheme

Africa, with immense amount of under-tapped oil reserves, vast stretches of ungoverned space, impoverished populations and pandemics of AIDS/HIV and other diseases, is now on Washington’s radar screen. The National Security Strategy for the United States, 2006 says: “Africa holds growing geo-strategic importance and is a high priority of this administration.” But the most significant way that high priority status is being expressed is through commitments of military aid, training, troops and equipment.

The U.S. base in Djibouti is just one component in a new military machine in Africa. There is also the Trans Sahara Counter Terrorism Initiative (TSCTI), which Congress funded at $500 million over six years in 2005. There are also increased naval maneuvers in West Africa’s Gulf of Guinea, and establishment of a P3 Orion aerial surveillance station in Algeria.

The AFRICOM command brings together most of the continent (Egypt will remain under CENTCOM. According to President Bush it “will enhance our efforts to bring peace and security to the people of Africa and promote our common goals of development, health, education, democracy, and economic growth in Africa.&amp;quot;

Even as these discussions continue, some African nations are receiving significant increases in military aid and weapons sales; most of these increases have gone to oil-rich nations and compliant states where the U.S. military seeks a strategic toehold. The Center for Defense Information recently completed U.S. Arms Exports and Military Assistance in the Global War on Terror, an analysis of increases in military aid since September 11, 2001. The report compares the military aid and weapons sales in the five-year leading up to 2001 and the five years since.

For example: since September 11, Kenya, which the State Department describes as a “frontline state” in the war on terrorism, has received eight times more military aid than in the preceding five years. Djibouti, which has opened its territory to U.S. forces, received forty times more military aid, and an eightfold increase in the value of weapons transfers. Oil-rich Algeria, where the surveillance equipment is based, has received ten times more aid and a warm embrace from Washington. Nigeria, the fifth largest supplier of oil to the United States, is slated to receive $1.35 million in Foreign Military Financing for 2008 despite persistent human rights abuses.

Mali is described as an “active partner in the war against terrorism” by the State Department and is a good example of a little military aid going a long way. The desert nation is slated to receive just $250,000 in International Military Education and Training (IMET funding) and no Foreign Military Financing in 2008. But, Mali participates in both the Regional Defense Counter Terrorism Fellowship Program and the Anti-terrorism Assistance program, receiving additional funding through these programs. Aid comes in other forms too. Just this week, a U.S. C-130 military transport plane dropped food aid to Malian soldiers as they pursued armed members of the Tuareg ethnic group. This sort of assistance is not documented or quantified in any ledger or report but — if repeated regularly — could significantly increase the Malian military’s capabilities.

As with the Arab world secutity becomes an excuse to clamp down on opposition groups and limiting freedom of the press and press as well as other things dictatorial regimes they don’t like.

Left : Ethiopian troops on the march

U.S. arms sales to Ethiopia, which has one of Africa’s largest armies, have roughly doubled and military aid has increased two and a half times. But the nation has not received military Humvees since 2002, when it used them against its own people. During protests following the May 2002 elections, the Ethiopian military fired on crowds from the Humvees, killing 85 people. The U.S. sold the Humvees to Ethiopia for counter-terrorism operations. This new military assistance will certainly not serve to enrich democratic institutions in the recipient states.

Left : Beneficiaries?

The formation of AFRICOM as a separate entity from USEUCOM and USCENTCOM – from the point of view of those who seek to use it as a tool for the war against terror (“TWAT”) ultimately, will be used (is being used) as the pre-text for Chicago-style economic reform (aka, free-market shock-therapy). That is,the military is being used to soften up Africa so that corporation can benifit from exploitation of Africa's resources. Moreover, by an intense military presence in Africa competitors such as India, China and Europe can be kept at bay.

This war on terror is a like a little fairy tale. There’s this place called Darfur in Sudan, and there are Islamicists in control of the North, while the oil is in the south. The World Bank got in bed with Exxon to finance a $4 billion oil Cameroon-Chad pipeline that ends up on the southwest edge of Sudan.

Suddenly, small black African tribes in the south that has been oppressed by the North for centuries began receiving arms shipments and launching attacks on their Northern Arabic opponents. How did they get those weapons? A fairy godmother sent it to them?

The Islamic regime responded by arming Arabic tribes, “Janjaweed”, and sending them on a wipe-out campaign to the south. “Genocide in Darfur” headlines began appearing in the Western corporate press, with no mention of how the militarization of situation arose. The nomadic tribes of Darfur were in conflict and competition with the sedentary people, but why now and how?

Fast forward, 400,000 dead people later, August 1, 2007. Blackwater and Cofer Black step up and offer to move in and pacify the region, and stop the genocide. Somehow, I doubt their humanitarian motivation, but there is no doubt that the Bush administration would prefer Blackwater over a UN peacekeeping contingent. The ongoing war for control of the last of the world’s oil continues.

As a further example of the misdirected war on terror, oil too, is the motivation for US policy in Somalia. Currently, the US obtains about 10 percent of its oil from Africa. However, the Monitor story noted ‘some experts say it may need to rely on the continent for as much as 25 percent by 2010.’ Reportedly, nearly two-thirds of Somalia’s oil fields were allocated to the U.S. oil companies Conoco, Amoco, Chevron and Phillips before Somalia’s pro-U.S. President Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown.” There is not a single area of Africa where the US military or mercenaries are active that does not have an oil reserve or other natural resources of some kind.

Left : War for oil - blood

African governments have answered the US 911 call. Almost without exception. These African leaders believe in the trickle down economic theory propounded by the neoconservatives - they anxiously, awajit at the feet of their benefactors for arms or dollars to trickle down. The greatest of whom are Gambia and Liberia, who have declared September 11th a national holiday&amp;quot;

David Atmor (left) hugged his son, Itay Atmor, 22, as he was brought into East Boston District this morning for his arraignment on charges of interfering with a flight en route to Israel.

(4/27/2009) A judge ordered a 20-day psychiatric evaluation today for a young man who was muttering that he lived "6,000 years ago" moments before allegedly rushing the cockpit of a plane en route from New York to Israel, according to a police report.

Itay Atmor sat in seat 40D, according to the police report. The passenger sitting next to him, Zeev Sinsusia, said he was having a normal conversation with Atmor when he suddenly mentioned that he "lived 6,000 years ago" and that "this is going to be a short flight to Israel."

He forced the plane to make an emergency landing in Boston after he allegedly hit several numbers on a keypad that locked the cockpit door of the Delta Air Lines flight heading to Tel Aviv. An off-duty pilot and three other passengers wrestled Atmor to the ground and ultimately tied him up with a seat belt and a cord from a pair of headphones, according to a police report filed today in court.

Atmor pleaded not guilty today in East Boston District Court and was sent to Bridgewater State Hospital. His attorney, David Meier, told reporters that Atmor was returning to his native Israel for psychiatric help.

Atmor is an Israeli citizen who has been living in Medford (Oregon) and, according to the police report, selling Dead Sea soap at the CambridgeSide Galleria mall.

His friend, Yosef Edri, told police that Atmor had served three years in an elite unit of the Israel Army. Full Story

Until recently, the recording industry were committing publicity suicide by routinely issuing legal threats to file sharers. Now, they seem to have changed the routine, going for fewer, but bigger targets. The goal is clear: if you own the Internet , you don’t have to worry about pirates — or anyone else.

Earlier this month, four Pirate Bay visionaries were given harsh fines and jail sentences. Their only crime: creating the largest, free, uncensored, versatile file sharing platform on the Internet. Soon after, Taiwan passed 3-strikes legislation for copyright violations.

The recording industry is no longer targeting pirates - they are actually trying to hijack the very fabric of the Internet.

The apparent strategy:

1. Outlaw file sharing
2. Outlaw personal encryption and anonymization services
3. Set up a global, privately-run Internet surveillance program to spy on everybody all the time without a warrant — run by ISPs and paid for by the taxpayers
4. And finally, get the authority to block anyone from the Internet entirely, without the involvement of police, courts or any verifiable trail of evidence

We can not let this happen.

“It is poor civic hygiene to install technologies that could someday facilitate a police state.” - Bruce Schneier

Sarkozy is trying to implement a 3-strikes & you're orwelled 'law'.

That wouldn't be usurping your God given rights and Common Law with the F ascist U niform C ommercial C ode, now would it? ~Gr♪m

The new agency that has been proposed will essentially take away any possibility of a fair trial the user may have had. How is it decided what is illegal activity and where is the line crossed?

Suzi Warren intentionally put nipple tassles on shirts for infants and preschool girls.

Warren is the owner and designer of Twisted Tees, a London clothing company some people find twisted indeed. The tassled top has been causing a buzz on the blogosphere.

Twisted Tees also offers clothes for babies and preschoolers that proclaim, "I've done f--k all day" (minus the dashes). Then there are alphabet shirts that announce that B is for Beer, C is for Condom and X is apparently for a pig having sexual relations with a duck.

Israeli soldiers accused of stealing body parts

Amsterdam News.Net 18th August, 2009
The Israeli Foreign Ministry has been angered by a Swedish report that said IDF soldiers abducted Palestinians to steal their organs

Sweden's largest circulation daily, Aftonbladet, raised the issue, by quoting Palestinians saying: "They plunder the organs of our sons."

In the story, which was accompanied by photographs, the Palestinians claimed IDF soldiers had kidnapped their sons to steal body parts.

The Israeli Foreign Ministry issued an immediate denial, calling the story "a grotesque libel."

A spokesman, saying the article was a shame to freedom of expression, claimed the demonising piece had once again encouraged hate crimes against Jews.

The article made reference to the recent arrests in New Jersey of several prominent US Jews for a number of alleged crimes, including brokering the sale of organs for transplant.

It quoted parents and relatives of Palestinian men who had supposedly been kidnapped and found dead, with organs removed.

The story also cited allegations of similar instances of organ-snatching in the West Bank in 1992, during Palestinian protests against the continued Israeli occupation.

Source: Amsterdam News

"Rabbi Ginsburgh asked rhetori-cally: 'If a Jew needs a liver, can you take the liver of an innocent non-Jew passing by to dave him? The Torah would probably permit that. Jewish life has an infinite value', he explained. 'There is something infinitely more holy and unique about Jewish life than non-Jewish life'."

(Prof. Israel Shahak and Norton Mezvinsky, "Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel", Pluto Press, London 1999, page 62)

Israel admitted that doctors at the L. Greenberg Institute of Forensic Medicine at Abu Kabir had harvested the organs of 3 Palestinian youth killed by the Israel army near Khan Younis. Attempting to cross the border between Palestine and Israel , the 15 and 17 year old boys were struck down by tank missiles courtesy of the Israeli militia.

Palestinians are in need of border crossing in order to find any menial work for pay with which to feed and support their families. The bodies of Khan Younis boys were not immediately returned for burial by the Israeli Occupation Authorities.

After 10 days the bodies were returned to their families for burial but with their organs and even their eyes removed.

UPDATE

The president of the official council of Jewish communities in Sweden said Wednesday that the tabloid story alleging that Israel plundered the bodies of Palestinians for organ transplants had not been picked up by other newspapers and therefore has not received much reaction from the Swedish Jewish community.

"This article is written by one person who is well known as being anti-Israel and anti-Semitic. It doesn't create a lot of reaction in the Swedish public," Lena Posner-Korosi told The Jerusalem Post regarding the Aftonbladet article.

It Wasn't Muslims

With a peer-reviewed scientific journal having published "loaded gun" (i.e. unreacted nano-thermite ) evidence finally proving beyond doubt that World Trade Center Buildings 1, 2 and 7 were brought down in a series of controlled demolitions, here are a few more facts to consider.

It wasn't Muslims in an Afghan cave who had access to highly energetic nano-thermites ; it was the US military and government scientists such as those connected with NIST .

It wasn't Muslims who ran a construction company that was awarded a $124 million contract for construction of the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) headquarters in Washington, DC , which oversees the Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC-IH), which was described during the 1990s as the " National Center for Energetics ", the military's term for "explosives work" , and as of 1999-2000 the " only reliable source of aluminum nanopowders in the United States "; it was Tom Leppert who was CEO of Turner Construction as of 9/11/01 , and who even writes parts of Presidential speeches .

It wasn't Muslims who ran a construction company that had supervised the 2000 demolition of the Seattle Kingdome , participated in the post 9/11 collection and disposal of the steel wreckage of the WTC towers, and carried out extensive renovations throughout the World Trade Center complex right up to the morning of 9/11 including fireproofing upgrades on the floors that were struck by planes and subsequently "failed", when the steel had already been certified to ASTM E119 by Universal Laboratories , and, in tests sponsored by NIST on corresponding floor assemblies subjected to greater heat exposure and protected with less fireproofing than was the case at the WTC , the test specimens " were able to sustain the maximum design load " without collapsing for as long as the tests were run (2 to 3 1/2 hours); it was Tom Leppert who was CEO of Turner Construction as of 9/11/01 and received a Torch of Conscience award from the American Jewish Congress .

It wasn't Muslims who trained their cameras on the World Trade Center Towers prior to the first aircraft impact , who danced and celebrated with high fives prior to the second impact as most onlookers still believed it had been a terrible accident rather than terrorism, and who were caught with foreign passports, $4,700 in cash hidden in a sock, maps highlighting certain places in the city, and a van that tested positive for traces of explosives ; it was Israelis Sivan Kurzberg, Paul Kurzberg, Yaron Shmuel, Oded Ellner, and Omer Marmari , several of whom have been confirmed as Mossad agents , as part of their job in " documenting the event ".

It wasn't Muslims who were caught on 9/11/01 operating in teams with vans full of explosives , including one team who attempted to blow up the George Washington Bridge with a truck packed with tons of explosives , and another who blew up a van between 6th and 7th on King Street with a mural painted of a remote controlled airplane diving into New York and blowing up ; it was Israelis , which is why the authorities did their best to ignore and bury these reports which included a suspected van bomb driven into the WTC basement and exploded to weaken the structure.

It wasn't Muslims who were caught shortly after midnight on May 7, 2002 very close to the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station , Oak Harbor, Wash., (where the Navy conducts explosive ordnance training for bomb disposal mobile units to the consternation of local marine life) with a rental truck that tested positive for TNT and RDX plastic explosives ; it was Israelis whose cover story was of "delivering furniture" but regarded by authorities as dubious because of the early morning hour, and the authorities' subsequent claim that the dog's reaction and initial tests for explosives were wrong is so full of holes that it merely demonstrates the power of the Israeli lobby .

It wasn't Muslims who were in New York on 9/11 and in London on the morning of the 7/7 attacks ; it was Benjamin Netanyahu and Rudy Giuliani .

It wasn't Muslims who received advance warning of the London 7/7 attacks; it was Benjamin Netanyahu and the Mossad .

It wasn't Muslims who provided two hours' advance warning of an attack on the World Trade Center via an instant messaging company based in Herzliya; it was Israelis .

It wasn't a Muslim who fled the US on September 14, 2001 ; it was Dominick Suter of " Urban Moving Systems " who fled to Israel .

It wasn't over a hundred Muslims who, from around January 2000 to September 2001 , posed as " art students " and attempted to penetrate US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) offices and other federal buildings including 36 sensitive Department of Defense (DoD) sites , were caught with diagrams of the interior of federal buildings and photographs of federal agents and often evaded security by entering through back doors or parking garages, and even visited the homes of senior federal officials but not those of their neighbors; it was Israelis , none of whom were "art students" but many of whom had backgrounds in Israeli military intelligence. Not surprisingly, the Press went for a limited hangout by trying to pretend the Israelis were merely shadowing "Arab hijackers" and either failed to pass on information, or " it was not treated seriously ", the old canard about " intelligence failure ". The operations of the Israeli fake "art students" is well documented , including plenty of names and even descriptions. An unusually large number of these Israelis were located in Irving, Dallas, TX (p.23, previous link), which is about ten miles west of Tom Leppert's Alva Court home , which is barely more than a mile north of the Dallas home that George W. Bush moved into after leaving office.

It isn't Muslim countries that have a massive spy ring in the USA capable of tapping into much of the telecoms network and using information obtained to blackmail Americans; it is Israel .

It wasn't Muslims who received advance warning on Monday September 10, 2001, against flying the next day; it was San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown , and a group of top Pentagon officials .

It wasn't Muslims who acquired a 99-year lease on the World Trade Center's Twin Towers, Buildings Four and Five and approximately 400,000 square feet of retail space , and insured for billions of dollars against terror attacks a mere six weeks before terror attacks did in fact occur , and then employed (to press for the insurance claim) a ' structural engineer ' who misleadingly asserts that steel loses half its strength at "400 degrees" ; it was - in a deal negotiated by Lewis Eisenberg of the Port Authority - Benjamin Netanyahu's (and Ariel Sharon's and Ehud Barak's) friend Larry Silverstein and his partner Australian billionaire and "Holocaust survivor" Frank Lowy who fought "in the Jewish underground", was embroiled in a high-level bank corruption scandal with Israeli Premier Ehud Olmert and found to be making payments to Lord (Michael Abraham) Levy who was arrested several times in relation to a "cash for honors" scandal, Levy being a "tennis partner" and advisor of Tony Blair .

It isn't Muslims who have a reputation for perpetrating arson scams in order to claim off insurance companies as evidenced by any colloquial use of the term "Muslim lightning"; it is Jews as evidenced by the recognized term " Jewish lightning ".

It wasn't Muslims who normally breakfasted at the Windows on the World restaurant on the 106th and 107th floors of the North Tower, but by some bizarre coincidence did not happen to be there on 9/11 and were thus spared the fate of occupants on that tragic day ( none of whom escaped from the floors above the aircraft impact at 8:46 AM); it was Larry Silverstein who was spared due to having a "dermatologist's appointment" , an event which also spared his two children who worked at Silverstein Properties.

It wasn't a Muslim who went on TV within hours of the attacks to tell everyone that "It... certainly has the fingerprints of somebody like bin Laden" and the World Trade Center had collapsed because of "the velocity of the plane" and "intense heat probably weakened the structure as well", and who reportedly on that very day advised the White House to take Cipro , an effective antibiotic against anthrax, seven days before the commencement of an anthrax letters terror campaign targeted at Democratic U.S. Senators and news media offices , who on 9/11/01 was a managing director of the crisis and consequence management group at Kroll Associates , who was an advisor to the Council of Foreign Relations (CFR) regarding "epidemiological surveillance" and national security advisor at the National Institute of Health (NIH), and who gave his 'friend' John O'Neill a job as Head Of Security at the World Trade Center ; it was Jerome Hauer .

It wasn't Muslims who carried out a terror campaign mailing letters containing anthrax spores that had their electrostatic charge altered so that they would disperse more readily , anthrax that was traced to the weapons grade Ames strain originating at the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick , neither was it the FBI's final "suspect" Roman Catholic Bruce Ivins , who, unlike the true perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks, had no motive to target news media and Opposition Senators and thereby scare them into uncritical acceptance of the "Arab hijackers" conspiracy theory. Ivins died of an overdose and alleged "suicide" in July 2008 after the FBI gave up attempting to pin the blame on Steven Hatfill because there was not a scintilla of evidence against him ; a logical suspect is Philip M. Zack who left Fort Detrick under a cloud in December 1991 after having headed a clique calling itself the "Camel Club" that was racially harassing Egyptian-born Dr. Ayaad Assaad . Zack was found by a 1992 inquiry to have been caught on surveillance camera being let into a Fort Detrick lab building at 8:40 p.m. on Jan. 23, 1992 apparently by Dr. Marian Rippy, a lab pathologist and close friend of Zack. The inquiry also found someone had been in a lab late at night secretly conducting unauthorised research, evidently on anthrax believed to include the Ames strain. Nearly ten years on, during the week between 9/11 and the commencement of the anthrax campaign, the FBI received an anonymous letter attempting to frame Dr. Assaad as a "bioterrorist" . The anthrax letters seemed contrived so as to appear to have been written by a Muslim , and a New York Times writer told of a "Mr. Z." who failed some FBI polygraph tests and was once caught with a girlfriend at Fort Detrick "surrounded only by blushing germs" .

It wasn't a Muslim who was claimed to have been killed on the alleged American Airlines "Flight 77", to have lived at Silver Spring, Maryland (as did a certain Rabbi Dr. Dov Zakheim ), and to have worked on top-secret " deep-black " projects at the Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC-IH), a " renowned leader in energetics " which operates an "Energetics Manufacturing Technology Center", carries out " advanced research in energetic systems " and "absorbed the function of the closed Naval Ordnance Laboratory , formerly in White Oak, MD" which is a couple miles from Silver Spring; it was William E. Caswell .

It wasn't Muslims who were claimed to have been killed on the alleged "Flight 77" and who worked for government or defense, particularly the Navy; it was John Yamnicky who, strangely, for the first time did not tell his daughter that he was going on trave l, and who, like William Caswell , had worked for the Navy on top-secret "black" projects. Others included Charles Burlingame , a former Navy fighter pilot who used to work in the section of the Pentagon that was hit and who had formulated a response for the eventuality of an airliner being flown into the Pentagon and whose daughter Wendy subsequently died in a " suspicious fire " at a 50-story high-rise in New Jersey in December 2006, Wilson "Bud" Flagg , a retired American Airlines pilot and Navy Admiral, Stanley Hall , an expert in anti-radar technology and a director of program management at Raytheon, Bryan Jack , a senior executive and top budget analyst who worked at the Pentagon, Chandler Keller , a Boeing propulsion engineer, Dong Lee , a Boeing engineer who worked for their Integrated Defense Systems and who had worked for the National Security Agency (NSA) for 14 years, Barbara Olson , CNN commentator and wife of the US Solicitor General who claimed to have received cell phone calls from "Flight 77", Ruben Ornedo , a Boeing propulsion / satellite communications engineer, Robert Penniger , an electrical engineer with BAE Systems, and another dozen alleged "Flight 77 passengers" who were linked to defense and government who, we are told, all just happened to be on this unusually low occupancy flight. These people, well loved and respected as honest, decent heroes, are the very sort of characters whose work could have been horrifically exploited without their knowledge, and whom the 9/11 perpetrators would need to eliminate to prevent them speaking out after the attacks.

It wasn't Muslims who profited by speculating on airline and insurance stocks in advance of 9/11 ; it was Israelis.

It wasn't Muslims who concocted a hoax about pork-swilling , money-eschewing , celibate , truthful , courageous , pro-animal rights , "devout Jews" who were "suicide hijackers / pilots", almost half of whom later turned up alive and well ; it was Jews who concocted a hoax about drinking , gambling , strip joint-frequenting , womanizing , "devout Muslims" who were "suicide hijackers / pilots", almost half of whom later turned up alive and well .

It wasn't a Muslim who was a former unit team leader in an elite special forces unit and whose father was a senior aide , secretary and pallbearer to a man who in 1937 was commander of the Irgun Tzvai Leumi , a Jewish terrorist organization responsible for atrocities such as the King David Hotel bombing ; it was Benjamin Netanyahu .

It wasn't a Muslim who was the mentor of Benjamin Netanyahu's father Benzion and who wrote a column in the Revisionist Zionist magazine Doar Hayom under the title "From the Notebook of a Fascist", praising Mussolini and referring to one-time commander of the Irgun Ze'ev (Vladimir) Jabotinsky as "our Duce"; it was Abba Ahimeir the founder of Revisionist Maximalism, a Jewish fascist ideology .

It wasn't Muslim terrorists who plotted to assassinate British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin ; it was Jewish terrorists .

It wasn't Muslims who orchestrated, and whose operatives were caught red-handed in, a failed false-flag terrorist campaign in Egypt ; it was Israel .

It wasn't Muslims who attacked the USS Liberty killing 34 Americans, and had the US President saying " I don't give a damn if every man drowns and the ship sinks. I don't want to embarrass our allies "; it was Israel .

It wasn't Muslims who were evacuated "apparently due to a specific security threat" in advance of the Amman, Jordan terror attacks on November 9, 2005 (9/11 by Israeli and European calendars), which included a blast at the Radisson hotel that was known to have emanated from a bomb hidden in a false ceiling , even though the official story held that it was really the work of "suicide bombers" and therefore by some bizarre coincidence the ceiling bomb must have been placed there previously by someone else; it was Israelis who were evacuated in advance of these attacks in which there were no Jewish casualties, most of the dead were Jordanian Sunni Muslims, two Israeli casualties were both Arabs, and five Palestinians died including Major-General Bashir Nafeh, the head of military intelligence in the West Bank .

It wasn't Muslims who were caught and arrested inside the Mexican Congress chamber on October 10, 2001 in possession of guns, grenades, dynamite, detonators and wiring while posing as "press photographers"; it was Mossad agent Salvador Guersson Smecke and Israeli illegal immigrant Saur Ben Zvi at the very time that Zionists would obtain maximum benefit from a false-flag terror attack that would mobilize support for the war on " Muslim terrorists " in Afghanistan that had been launched only three days previously .

It wasn't Muslims who were convicted and jailed for six months in 2004 for fraudulently attempting to obtain a New Zealand passport in the name of a tetraplegic man ; it was Mossad agents Uriel Kelman and Eli Cara who were seeking to create a false identity for Zev Barkan.

It wasn't Muslims who claimed to know the identity of "suicide hijackers" Abdulaziz al-Omari and Saeed al-Ghamdi when, since individuals with the exact same names and other personal details such as birth date, place and occupation subsequently turned up alive and well , the population of Saudi Arabia in 1975 was 7,180,000 and even given a high annual birth rate of 30 per 1,000 and ignoring infant mortality the daily birth rate was only 590 and so it is highly improbable that individuals would share the exact same name, birth date, place and occupation, al-Omari's passport had been stolen in 1995 when his apartment was burgled in Denver, Colorado ( a state where Mossad agents have been active ), and only utter cretins would steal the identities of people with a different appearance but having their exact same name, place, date of birth and occupation , ergo those hypothetical "suicide hijackers" would have had entirely different names; it was the FBI who published a list claiming that the 9/11 perpetrators included Abdulaziz al-Omari and Saeed al-Ghamdi in addition to several others who had turned up alive and well , and even though the FBI admitted that some hijackers may have used stolen identities and that there is " no legal proof to prove the identities of the suicidal hijackers ," they denied having misidentified the alleged "suicide hijackers" and refused to change the names, photographs or backgrounds on their list - albeit obfuscating and trying to cover themselves by including multiple spellings and aliases.

It wasn't Muslims who were behind a failed coup in Turkey ; it was crypto-Jew and Mossad agent pseudo-Rabbi Tuncay Guney , who fled to Canada in 2004, and who in 2001 lived in New Jersey towns that were centers of activity for Mossad Urban Moving Systems operatives .

It wasn't Muslims who set up an " al Qaeda cell " in Palestine; it was the Israeli Mossad .

It wasn't Muslims who had established a reputation for having the capability to stage false-flag terror attacks , i.e., to target U.S. forces and make it look like the act of a third party, prior to 9/11; it was the Mossad.

It wasn't a Muslim who infiltrated the Pentagon and betrayed his country of birth by selling classified documents to another country that were then traded to the USSR; it was convicted spy Jonathan Pollard whose treachery resulted in stolen nuclear secrets being passed on to the USSR with Israel as the paying intermediary .

It wasn't Muslims who were running an exercise commencing at 9:00 a.m. on the morning of 9/11 involving a plane crashing into a tower; it was officials at the National Reconnaissance Office, Chantilly, VA .

It wasn't a Muslim who, in response to the question " Do the orders still stand ?" regarding the response - or more precisely, the lack of response - to an aircraft that was rapidly homing in on the Pentagon and ten miles out after both of the Twin Towers had already been hit by planes more than half an hour previously , whipped his neck around and replied "Of course the orders still stand. Have you heard anything to the contrary?"; it was Dick Cheney .

It wasn't a Muslim who was CEO of a company that made remote control "Flight Termination Systems" that could electronically hijack in-flight aircraft and steer them into targets by means of a "Command Transmitter System" ; it was Rabbi Dov Zakheim.

It wasn't a Muslim who, well aware that a percentage of trillions of dollars is still hundreds of billions of dollars, took a position as Comptroller of the Pentagon in May 2001 when it was already public knowledge that the Pentagon's accounting systems were in complete disarray with $6.9 trillion of "adjustments" having been required in an attempt to make the figures add up, and with no receipts for $2.3 trillion of these hard to track changes on non-integrated computer systems and antiquated paperwork that could be readily taken out by a missile or plane strike on the relevant auditing section at the Pentagon, and who subsequently delivered a commemorative sermon on the Pentagon lawn to hundreds of co-religionists from 40 countries six months after such a terror strike did in fact occur killing at least 34 budget analysts / accountants / financial experts ; it was Rabbi Dov Zakheim .

It wasn't a Muslim who was at a breakfast meeting with Donald Rumsfeld when the first plane hit the WTC , and was at the Army Navy Country Club " when the plane that hit the Pentagon came right over the top of the Army Navy Club and bounced down the hill and hit the side of the Pentagon "; it was Thomas E. White , who is linked to the Enron fraud , who participated in JINSA trips to Israel, e.g. with his wife Susan in 1997 , and who was sworn in as Secretary of the Army on May 31, 2001 which is 27 days after George W Bush appointed Rabbi Dov Zakheim as Undersecretary of Defense and Comptroller of the Pentagon , both White and Zakheim having been placed by Bush at the Pentagon where more than $2 trillion of transactions had no receipts and Pentagon finances were vulnerable to a "terror attack" that would target the appropriate auditing section .

It wasn't Muslims who in 2000 co-authored a document which called for a " new Pearl Harbor "; it was Roger Barnett, Alvin Bernstein, Stephen Cambone, Eliot Cohen, Devon Gaffney Cross, Thomas Donnelly, David Epstein, David Fautua, Dan Goure, Donald Kagan, Fred Kagan, Robert Kagan, Robert Killebrew, William Kristol, Mark Lagon, James Lasswell, I. Lewis Libby, Robert Martinage, Phil Meilinger, Mackubin Owens, Steve Rosen, Gary Schmitt, Abram Shulsky, Michael Vickers, Barry Watts, Paul Wolfowitz, and Rabbi Dov Zakheim.

It wasn't Muslims who had a motive for employing a " Flight Termination System " to take control of EgyptAir Flight 990 - a Boeing 767 - on October 31, 1999 (after a bizarre coincidence in which " air crash victims grief counselor " Ed McLaughlin of the Family Enterprise Institute was the only person to board the ill-fated plane in Los Angeles and get off at New York), send it plunging into the Atlantic 60 miles south of Nantucket killing all 217 on board, none of whom were Israelis but 33 of the casualties were Egyptian army officers including two Air Force brigadier generals and two army major generals, and promote the concept of " Muslim suicide pilots " to a gullible public; it was Jews who would have needed to conduct a trial run of electronically hijacking in-flight Boeing aircraft for their imminent false-flag terror operation that was to be blamed on "Muslim suicide pilots / hijackers", with the EgyptAir Flight 990 "inquiry" being overseen by Zionist Jew Bernard Loeb who had Jewish translators transcribe the cockpit recordings, and the FBI conducting a character assassination to smear the alleged "suicidal" co-pilot.

It wasn't Muslims who wrote in 1998 of a "transforming event" rather like "Pearl Harbor" ; it was John Deutsch , Ashton Carter and Philip Zelikow .

It wasn't a Muslim who served as Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission , whose expertise and job entailed the creation and maintenance of public myths or "presumptions" , and who confirmed that the Iraq war had been for Israel's benefit ; it was Philip Zelikow.

It wasn't Muslims who published a paper in 1996 entitled A Clean Break : A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, which mentioned " removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq " and introduced the concept of pre-emptive strikes for which some phony pretext such as halting drug money or striking counterfeiting infrastructure or "weapons of mass destruction" could be devised that Americans would sympathise with; it was The Institute for Advanced Strategic & Political Studies (IASPS) of Jerusalem and Washington which, for new Israeli Premier Benjamin Netanyahu , discussed how such a policy would benefit Israel .

It wasn't a Muslim who, in a 1995 book, predicted that " if the West doesn’t wake up to the suicidal nature of militant Islam, the next thing you will see is militant Islam is bringing down the World Trade Center "; it was Benjamin Netanyahu.

It wasn't Muslim security officials who, in 1991, inspected the garage of a Muslim shipping company in the World Trade Center and concluded that the WTC garage was vulnerable to a car bomb , two years before the WTC garage was in fact hit by a car bomb and the FBI were aware of the plot yet let it go ahead killing six people and injuring more than a thousand, and ten years before the WTC was demolished one week after the very same shipping company had moved out of the WTC ; it was Israeli security officials and an Israeli shipping company .

It wasn't Muslims who paid Ali al-Jarrah more than $300,000 for services rendered , i.e., posing as a "supporter" of the Palestinian cause while betraying his country to an enemy state, and who was a cousin of Ziad al-Jarrah who was alleged to be one of nineteen 9/11 "suicide hijackers"; it was Israel that paid this Mossad asset .

It wasn't Muslims who 1) broadcast the pilot episode on March 4, 2001 of The Lone Gunmen TV series, an episode about a plot by a secret cabal within the US government to electronically hijack by remote control a Boeing heading for Boston and divert it to crash into the World Trade Center 2) said in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks that no one had ever conceived of aircraft being used by terrorists as missiles to target buildings; it was 1) Fox TV, owned by Rupert Murdoch , a long-time friend of Benjamin Netanyahu 2) National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice / acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard Myers / President George W. Bush / Vice President Dick Cheney / White House spokesman Ari Fleischer .

It wasn't a Muslim who said he'd seen the (first) plane hit the (North) Tower and reckoned it must have been "one terrible pilot" and "a horrible accident" before going into a classroom and subsequently being informed of the second impact when the first impact was not broadcast live on TV; it was George W. Bush .

It wasn't Muslims who, on Tuesday, October 2 through Friday, October 5, 2001 : 1) met with, and 2) received $3 million in gifts for "funds for victims" from Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifah Al-Thani , the Emir of Qatar who started the Al Jazeera channel in 1996 with a $150 million grant, the channel which broadcasts audios and videos purporting to be of " Osama bin Laden " aka Emmanuel Goldstein ; it was: 1) George W. Bush , Dick Cheney (an "old friend") - Cheney also met the Emir on October 20, 2001 to discuss the "Osama" interviews, Rudy Giuliani, Colin Powell , Paul Wolfowitz, and Richard Myers 2) Rudy Giuliani , Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Myers .

It wasn't Muslims who fabricated a fairy stor y about Pfc. Jessica Lynch being ambushed, stabbed, shot, bravely continuing to shoot Iraqis, being abused, raped , and held captive in a hospital by Iraqi guards, and later rescued by elite US forces; it was " unnamed US officials " who lied , since in fact there was no "rescue", Lynch's gun had jammed with sand, she was being cared for by the Iraqis after being injured in a car crash, she had no "bullet holes" or "knife wounds", the hospital was not "under guard", and doctors had even tried to return Lynch to US forces themselves.

It wasn't Muslims who conspired to invade a defenseless nation by lying about " weapons of mass destruction " ("WMDs") when they had already made up their minds to invade for "regime change" , resulting in excess Iraqi deaths estimated at 655,000 to one million , the displacement of more than four million , the sacrifice of thousands of troops and throwing away of $3 trillion to no avail save for enriching a few war criminals and profiteers to the tune of billions of dollars in this proxy war for Israel ; it was George W. Bush and Tony Blair .

It wasn't a Muslim who ordered aides to plan for striking Iraq barely five hours after the Pentagon was attacked on 9/11; it was Donald Rumsfeld .

It wasn't Muslims who ordered 250 police to smash their way into a house in Forest Gate , London, in the middle of the night and arrest two brothers after shooting one of them in the shoulder, on the basis of intelligence said to be from a "reliable", single source regarding a conspiracy involving a "cyanide bomb", with the brothers being released without charge several days later before it was subsequently revealed that the source was a man with an IQ of 69 who was already in jail on a terror conviction ; it was Jewish supremacist lackeys MI5, Tony Blair and John Reid .

It isn't Muslim countries that have hundreds of nuclear warheads and submarines equipped with cruise missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads with a 900-mile range ; it is Israel.

It isn't Muslims that have a powerful political lobby capable of extorting vast sums ; it is Israel.

It wasn't a Muslim who boasted "We Muslims control America, and the Americans know it"; it was Ariel Sharon who boasted "We, the Jewish people, control America, and the Americans know it".

It isn't Muslims who fake phony "hate crimes" against themselves, such as vandalising their own cars or graves , or poisoning their dogs and defacing their houses with swastikas , or cutting their clothes and drawing swastikas on their stomachs ; it is Jews.

It wasn't Muslims who took control of The New York Times in 1896 , or who indeed own and control much of the mainstream media today ; it was and is Jews.

It isn't a Muslim country that crushes peace protesters to death with bulldozers or shoots them , or shells a picnicking family on a beach (and then refuses to own up ) when it wants to launch a war within the next three weeks , or warns civilians to flee after blowing up bridges so it can target them like sitting ducks , or shoots at Red Cross ambulances or UN observers after promising they would be safe, or bombs a power station so that more than ten thousand tonnes of crude oil leaks into the Mediterranean as a " collective punishment "; it is Israel.

It isn't Muslims who routinely employ weapons such as phosphorus shells to inflict grave and horrific injuries on civilians , and who deliberately fire more than a million cluster bomblets of which 40% fail to detonate on impact and 90% are employed in the final three days before a ceasefire so they can "get them all in while the going is good"; it is Israel.

It isn't a Muslim nation that holds the world record for defying UN resolutions ; it is Israel .

It wasn't Muslims who ganged up on a handicapped Jew for hiking on his own land, beat him with clubs, dragged him along the ground, tied him to a power pole and continued to beat and kick him as Muslim soldiers did nothing to stop it and police merely advised the thugs to pour water on the victim's head to wash away the blood before journalists and photographers arrived; it was a gang of four cowardly, bigoted Jewish settlers who beat up a handicapped Palestinian with impunity, basking in the knowledge that Jewish soldiers and police would not act impartially, and even returning a week later to torment the neighbors , ransacking their home and destroying their few possessions.

It wasn't Muslim soldiers who beat up and killed a Jew with clubs and rifle butts and kicks to the head and then, after an 'investigation', concluded that the soldiers had "acted properly"; it was the Israeli "Defense" Forces who smashed three holes in a Palestinian teenager's skull killing him as he merely waited at a bus stop, continuing to beat him as he lay unconscious, then made up a story about him "pulling a knife" and suggested that he was "mentally unstable" in a case that is sadly all too typical of violence perpetrated by racist, bigoted right-wing extremist Jewish supremacists upon those whom they perceive as " animals in human form ".

It wasn't Muslims who created a global organization named the "Anti Defamation League" in order to defend Muslim criminals by playing the race card and accusing their pursuers of being "racists" and " anti-Semites " who were guilty of " hate crimes "; it was Jews who set up the Anti Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in response to the lynching of Leo Frank , president of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith Jewish secret society who had been convicted of murdering 13-year-old Mary Phagan who worked at Frank's pencil factory, with the lynching of Frank being in response to the commuting of his death sentence to life imprisonment after organized Jewry had tried to cast doubt on Frank's conviction by shifting the blame to a black man even though ritual murder is a known Jewish tradition , the ADL being used thereafter to denounce anti-criminals as " anti-Semites " whenever the criminals happened to be Jews .

It isn't Muslims who, for political and financial gain, demolished the World Trade Center with nano-thermite and crashed remote-controlled planes into it in order to set up a hoax about "Jewish kamikaze pilots" and then attempt to throw researchers off the scent by pretending to "investigate" the demolitions whilst 'accidentally' plumping for the wrong hypothesis (e.g. H-bombs rather than thermite) , and then stubbornly refuse to change to a hypothesis that is in accordance with the evidence ; it is Jews who set up a hoax about " Muslim kamikaze pilots " and have their deliberately misleading ' work ' about the demolitions hosted at sites that are owned and edited by Jews .

It wasn't Muslims who practised pseudo-science by refusing to look for Iron Blue at Auschwitz or explosives at the World Trade Center , in order that their 'investigation' would come up with the required financially and politically motivated result; it was Jan Markiewicz, Wojciech Gubala, and Jerzy Labedz of the Jan Sehn Institute at Krakow (Auschwitz fraud), and "scientists" and "engineers" at NIST (WTC fraud).

It wasn't Muslims who took over the "investigation" of the World Trade Center collapses when FEMA were making a hash of the cover up, mixed up Figures 11-51 and 11-52 in NCSTAR1-9Vol2 on their WTC7 report which was published two days after the mysterious death of eyewitness Barry Jennings whose testimony of explosions in WTC7 before either Tower had collapsed - note he specifically says (4:43) " I was trapped in there when both buildings came down " - blew their politically motivated assumptions and conclusions apart, failed to spot their mistake in their accompanying description, assumed unrealistically high gas temperatures in order to derive their required unrealistically high steel temperatures, published a preposterous hypothesis of a " thermal-expansion "-based collapse with the logical conclusion that the 180 kip shear capacity of four bolts in a seated connection would be exceeded if the steel heated up from 20 C to 32 C making the force to completely resist the thermal expansion 191 kip , irrespective of the fact that no steel-framed high-rises had ever collapsed due to "fires" or "impacts" apart from the three that allegedly did so on 9/11, claimed inward bowing of the WTC1 perimeter columns between floors 94 to 100 peaking at 55 inches at column 316 on the 96th floor which could not be reconciled with the fact that the columns' moment of inertia or second moment of area was at least 342 ins^4 along the minor axis and a maximum deflection of 55 inches given fixed - fixed boundary conditions and a distributed load would have required the failure within 102 minutes of at least ten consecutive floors, many of which did not have any fireproofing 'dislodged' by a plane and did not even experience substantial fires; it was NIST, whose top scientists and engineers have extensive knowledge of nano-thermites , but said they had found "no evidence" of explosives at the WTC and later admitted that they had not bothered to look for any . The 9/11 perpetrators had to ensure those in charge of the "investigation" were aware of that which they must not find.

It wasn't a Muslim who announced on Sunday September 16, 2001 that a "hijacker's passport" (allegedly that of Satam al Suqami) had been found " several blocks from the ruins of the World Trade Center ", with other reports asserting that the passport was found " in the vicinity of Vesey Street "; it was former Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik who was indicted November 2007 on multiple counts including lying, fraud and conspiracy, which is consistent with the fact that the laws of aerodynamics dictate that the passport should have been found in the vicinity of Liberty Street , the scriptwriter forgot that Suqami was supposed to be on Flight AA11 approaching from the north, and, of several attempts made by the authorities to guess where the passport should have been found, not one of them was correct!

It wasn't Muslims who had JFK killed; it was Jews .

It wasn't Muslims who stole elections by exploiting electronic voting machines that biased the results such that the odds for several swing states to swing as much as they did from the exit polls was 250 million to one against ; it was George W. Bush.

It isn't Muslims who exhibit traits of supremacist megalomaniacs by referring to their enemies as "grasshoppers", "beasts", "crocodiles" and "cockroaches" ; it is Jews .

It wasn't a Muslim who set up a Ponzi scheme that netted $50 billion ; it was a Jew .

It wasn't Muslims who made a record about doing " The Wall Street Shuffle " and whose other songs included scatological references ; it was Jews.

It isn't Muslims who rule the world by proxy and get others to fight and die for them in wars; it is Jews, whose modus operandi is to select rich host populations that will let them in , pose as their "ally" whilst draining them of hard-earned wealth, employ deception to trick the hosts into fighting poorer nations, and reap the spoils of war such as Afghan opium trafficking, missing Pentagon funds , looting of oil-for-food funds , etc, along with other opportunistic scams such as the $550 billion electronic run on the banks . Note: some reports incorrectly state Thursday September "15", 2008 for the latter; it should of course be September 11, the Thursday prior to September 15.

It isn't Muslims who have been expelled from countries on numerous occasions , it is Jews who keep getting kicked out as soon as the host gets wise to the fact that Jews' only loyalty is to their own tribe , rather than the host nation to whom Jews pose as an "ally".

It wasn't Muslims who started a World War in 1914 in the hope that they could successfully launch a hoax about " six million " of their number being killed in order to obtain their own country and net a substantial fraction of global wealth in "reparations", failed, but also exploited the opportunity to annex and loot Russia and indulge in horrific blood-letting and oppression as a means of settling old scores with the Rus who had chased them westwards from former Khazaria ; it was Khazar (fake) 'Jews' .

It wasn't Muslims who blew up Francois Duprat's car killing him and maiming his wife , beat up Dr. Robert Faurisson at least ten times in which his jaw was broken / teeth knocked out / nearly killed several times / hospitalized for weeks and was persecuted in legal battles and had his home raided by police , tried to kill Ernst Zundel on at least three occasions in arson and pipe bomb attacks and had him and Germar Rudolf deported to Germany and jailed for years , beat Jurgen Rieger unconscious and blew up his car , beat up David Cole and threatened to kill him and his family , persecuted and beat Joseph Burg , attacked Frank Walus seven times and nearly killed him in an acid attack, forced Ivan Lagace to resign from his job as a crematory expert after endless threats from thugs claiming to be from the Jewish Defense League , perpetrated numerous terrorist attacks in France including sulfuric acid sprayed into faces / attacks with iron bars / baseball bats / gas sprayed / excrement strewn around, had historian David Irving spend 400 days in jail before being released on Appeal from a three year sentence which was for two speeches and a newspaper interview he gave 16 years earlier , had Dr. Frederick Toben jailed in Germany for ten months for using his Australian website to express his views, and who had dozens more jailed , fined , and financially ruined by character assassination and legal battles ; it was Jews attempting to prop up their idiosyncratic brand of "truth" which profited them handsomely for decades .

It wasn't Muslims who fabricated a hoax about "six million" of their people being "murdered" involving an evidence-free conspiracy theory about a plot to exterminate them in " gas chambers " which netted them - by way of a huge, illegitimate land grab - their own sovereign state, colossal profits in " reparations ", hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign "aid" and "loan guarantees" and waiving / subsidizing of interest payments , etc, and now serves as their "sword and shield" to practice apartheid and kill and oppress their enemies with impunity; it was Jews .

It wasn't Muslims who were caught red-handed forging fake "smoke" onto wartime photographs of Auschwitz ; it was the Simon Wiesenthal Center , whose suitability as guardians of truth is comparable to a choice of Count Dracula as a maintainer of blood banks.

It isn't Muslim mathematics that holds that the sum of a set of variables a + b + c + d + e... remains constant, e.g. at " six million ", when several variables fluctuate downwards by, say, nearly three million and about half of that , in the absence of any corresponding upwards revision; it is financially and politically motivated Jewish " mathematics ".

It isn't Muslim physics and chemistry that holds that corpses may be rapidly and economically cremated with between a pound and a kilogram of coke per body when the firebricks of the cremation ovens are not even replaced after some 20,000 cremations (which is rather like expecting a Trabant to be capable of doing 100,000 miles non-stop at 100 mph on 100 gallons of gasoline and a couple of cans of motor oil); it is politically and financially motivated Jewish " physics " and Jewish " chemistry ".

It wasn't Muslims - or even the " Russian police " - who behave as if they authored The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion ; it is International Jewry , and if it hisses like a snake and rattles like a rattlesnake, it isn't exactly benign .

It is not the "international Muslim" who has much to answer for; it is the international Jew .

The mainstream media’s conspicuous silence over the collapse of the official 9/11 conspiracy theory has clearly exposed them as "the dogs that didn’t bark".

This was inspired by an excellent piece from back in November 2003: It Wasn't Arabs by Edgar J. Steele

2 days of film and ideas to challenge and expand our worldview. There were several live video feeds bringing people in from all over the planet. We connected with people like Rob Hopkins of Transition Network in the UK, Andy Bichlbaum, half of the famous “ Yes Men ” duo, Mike Fincken, the skipper of the Rainbow Warrior – who were in the Thames River at the time, and others.

http://yesterdaysfuture.net/blog/?p=345

Some local personalities and some imports from Auckland made for a lineup of presentations that covered wide ranging topics, to compliment the diverse offering of (mostly) documentary film.

Despite the weather – you can see the tent flapping in the howling winds over that weekend – it was a bright and energetic two day celebration of community and the power of people to self-organise around important issues.

Occupation701 - Violence in Afghanistan

Violence in Afghanistan has spiked to its highest level since the 2001 US-led invasion, with an Asssocioted Press count of insurgency related deaths this year surpassing the 5,000 mark and a U.N. report finding that attacks have risen by 20 percent.

A suicide attack Tuesday on a police bus in western Kabul killed 13 officers and civilians, including a woman and her two children who boarded the vehicle seconds before the explosion.

The bombing, which ripped the roof off the bus, was the second to target a bus in Kabul in four days. It came as insurgents turned up attacks against Afghanistan’s security forces during a year of record violence.
Left : German soldiers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)-led International security Assistance Forces stand near a Tornado jet at an airbase in Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan. A new U.N. report found that while 76 percent of all suicide bombings in the country have targeted international and Afghan security forces, 143 civilians were killed by those bombs through August. The report, released in New York last week, also found that Afghanistan has averaged 550 violent incidents per month this year, up from 425 last year.

Left : Much of Afghanistan is like a scene from Mad Max or some futurist post-apocalypse movie&amp;quot;. This graveyard of Russian tanks will soon feature a new generation of military hardware that too, will rust in the desert.
An AP count of insurgency-related deaths, meanwhile, reached 5,086 so far this year, the most deaths in Afghanistan since the invasion to topple the Taliban. The AP counted some 4,000 deaths in 2006, based on reports from Western and Afghan officials.

The AP tally counts more than 3,500 militants among the dead, but also more than 650 civilians killed either by militant violence or U.S. or NATO attacks. Almost 180 international soldiers have died in Afghanistan this year, including 85 Americans, a record pace. Last year, about 90 U.S. soldiers died in Afghanistan.
Left : Afghan locals and morgue employees check dead bodies lined up at Ghazni hospital, in Ghazni province, 25 September 2007. At least 25 people were killed 24 September, in a head-on collision between two buses on one of Afghanistan's main roads, an Afghan news agency cited police as saying. Another 35 people were wounded in the crash on the main road linking Kabul and the southern city of Kandahar, Ghazni province police chief Alishah Ahmadzai said.
Insurgents have also launched a record number of suicide attacks — more than 100 — including two bus bombings in Kabul since Saturday that killed 43 people between them.

Four children were among the 13 people killed in Tuesday’s suicide attack by a man wearing a pakul — an Afghan hat commonly seen in the country’s north — and a shawl around the upper half of his body called a chador, said Amin Gul, who owns a metalworking shop next to the blast site.

“When the bus came, an old man got on, then a woman with two children, then the guy wearing the chador entered, and then a big boom,” said Gul, who witnessed the attack.
Left : Afghan people look on as a vehicle destoyed in a suicide attack is loaded onto a truck in Kabul, 29 September 2007. A suicide bomb that ripped through an army bus in the Afghan capital killed at least 27 military personnel and wounded 21 more, the ministry of defence said.

The seats in the front of the bus were covered in blood and small body parts, and workers washed blood from nearby trees after the attack. Ten people were wounded in the bombing, Health Minister Mohammad Amin Fatemi said.

Ahmad Saqi, a 20-year-old mechanic, said he helped put seven people in vehicles for runs to the hospital, and that several of the wounded had no legs.

“One woman was holding a baby in her arms, and they were both killed,” Saqi said. “Half of the woman’s face was blown off.”

The blast killed eight police, the mother, her baby and another child, as well as two unaccompanied children who had been heading to a special school for handicapped students, Fatemi said. The children ranged in age from 2 to 8.

“The woman’s husband is working at the Health Ministry. How do we tell the father his wife and two kids are dead?” asked Fatemi. “This attack goes against all of Islam. There is no reason to blow up Muslims, especially during the holy month of Ramadan. My message to these people: Please stop killing Muslims.”

Tuesday’s explosion is the third attack in four months against police or army buses in Kabul.

On Saturday, a suicide bomber wearing an army uniform blew himself up in an army bus, killing 30 people. In June, a bomb ripped through a bus carrying police instructors in Kabul, killing 35 people in the deadliest insurgent attack since the 2001 invasion.

A coalition soldier was killed by gunfire Tuesday morning while conducting combat operations in the northeastern province of Kunar. Three other soldiers were wounded, the coalition said in a statement. The nationalities of the soldiers weren’t provided, but most soldiers in eastern Afghanistan are American.

A suicide bomber, apparently targeting a police bus today detonated explosives strapped to his body killing 11 people, six of them police, and wounded seven others in Kabul, the second deadly attack in the capital within a week.
Militants in Kunar attacked a border security post, killing three police, said Zargun Shah Khaliqyar, a spokesman for the provincial governor. It was not clear if the two incidents in Kunar were related.

Canadian troops in Kandahar shot and killed a 35-year-old man and wounded a child in what NATO’s International Security Assistance Force called an “accidental discharge” by a weapons system.

The Afghan Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said Afghan and coalition soldiers battled insurgents in Uruzgan province on Sunday, killing 26 of the militants. There was no way to independently verify the claim.

NY Times policy: if your letter attacks Iran & Palestine as "terror state" & your surname Jew, improved chance it will be published

Disproportionate ratio of letters to the NYT sent by the Jews.

Evidence 1: The Palestinians' Voice 5/28/09

Evidence 2: Another Challenge for Obama - Iran (four out of six letters appear to be Jewish) 5/28/09

Evidence 3: Of Memory and Israel 5/24/09

Evidence 4: LETTERS; " What should we ask of Israel now? " (all Jews)

Evidence 5: Taking Care of Business (feebly written; letter gets published as a bonus point for possessing a Jewish surname) 5/28/09

Evidence 6: The U.N. Racism Conference (second letter sent by a dual citizen Israeli Zionist) 4/23/09

Evidence 7: Ahmadinejad and Israel 4/23/09

Evidence 8: LETTERS; Hate Speech at a Racism Conference (all whiny f*cking Jews, including Abraham Foxman of a Zionist terrorist organization ADL) 4/22/09

I sent a few constructively argued letters to New York Times on topics in the past. Never published anywhere but exclusive to NYT.

No matter how brilliantly written the letter might be, if you are a "nobody" (no background -- college diploma in a specialized field, established author, professor, organizer, former diplomat, former government official, etc) and you don't have a Jewish surname, chances are poor your letter will be published. (edit: no phone call for verification after two or more days)

The fact that my surname sounds German (I am quarter German), in conjunction with my truth-telling opinion (mention illegal immigration/flood of migration leeching state handout system and political corruption as two reasons for California fiscal crisis and the editor cringes in automated political correctness as "truth filter"), cause the constructive, thought-provoking letter to end up in the trash folder at NYT email mainframe furnish proof New York Times is Jewish-dominated in its utter and hysterical bias towards anything not of the "Master Race."

New York Times deserves to kabosh because it serves as the premier propaganda rag by the Jews for the Jews in support of Zionism and dumb Goyim who cannot think critically when faced with Zionist infection of American newspaper business, instead engage in cognitive dissonance in regards to the disparity of Jewish media monopoly and fair & equal access to diversified opinions by the non-Jews in the subverted United States of Israel-America.

The corporate owners of the newspaper business wonder why they keep losing money. It's because the informed American public is sick of the propaganda pushed on them since Iraq War turned out terribly that misled the public with lies, half-truth and spin by Zionist cabal of Neocons & Neolibs.

Edit: We know New York Times as the ultimate elitist newspaper that prides itself as the mouthpiece for the ruling Establishment and Zionists. Some superlatively written "human interest" articles are worth reading that respects the social merit of journalism and that's it. I will never buy a copy of NY Times in physical form or click on the ad by the side of the online article; I await its eventual and deserving demise. The rest is spin and garbage (e.g. columns by pretentious, self-important shitheads like Thomas Friedman included).

Jewish Center Hissy Fit Bomb Threat "Not a Hate Crime"

Police arrested Christopher Jacob Stefanelli, 22, in connection with a July 14 phone bomb threat that led to the evacuation of people from the Tulsa Jewish Retirement and Health Care Center.

Police said the threat was motivated by a domestic dispute with Stefanelli's boyfriend, who works at the Jewish Retirement Center, and “that was the reason he made the call,” Officer Jason Willingham said.

During a search of the campus, employees heard a ticking noise coming from a paper-filled trash can, and police evacuated the retirement center of dozens of residents and children.

The finding of a ticking device — later determined to be a clock — at the center on the same day was purely coincidental, and the clock is not believed to have been placed there by Stefanelli, Officer Jason Willingham said.

Police determined that the telephone call was placed from Stefanelli’s phone. Stefanelli confessed to making the call and was arrested.

Detectives don’t think the bomb threat was a hate crime or a Homeland Security issue, police reported.

Round up 'hate speech' promoters?

CBS News and U.S. News have posted a stunning, disturbing opinion piece by Bonnie Erbe. Here's who she is, for those of you who may not be familiar with her work:

Bonnie Erbe is a contributing editor at U.S. News & World Report and hosts PBS's weekly news analysis program, To the Contrary with Bonnie Erbe. She also writes a weekly syndicated newspaper column for Scripps Howard News Service.

Top credentials. Her voice is loud and reaches far. Here's what it's saying:

Round Up Hate-Promoters Now, Before Any More Holocaust Museum Attacks

Erbe takes her lead from a statement made by Playwright Janet Langhart Cohen [Langhart is the wife of war profiteer and former Sec'y of Defense, William Cohen, who is also on the board of AIG] on CNN following the Holocaust Museum shooting:

She said something must be done about ridding the Internet and the public dialogue of hate speech. I agree.

And what is that "something"?

Isn't it time we started rounding up promoters of hate before they kill?

And what's Bonnie wish for some people she doesn't like? HEART ATTACKS for one Clarence Thomas, Supreme Court Justice.

Obama's next Czar to head the Department of PreCrime? The imperious Bonnie Erbe, in all her glory.

It was on Erbe’s To the Contrary that a panelist wished Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas would die . On the November 4, 1994 edition, then-USA Today columnist and Pacifica Radio talk show host Julianne Malveaux, spewed: "The man is on the Court. You know, I hope his wife feeds him lots of eggs and butter and he dies early like many black men do, of heart disease. Well, that’s how I feel. He is an absolutely reprehensible person."

And more from the gracious host, Erbe:

On the PBS public-affairs show To the Contrary over the weekend, host Bonnie Erbe told panelist Linda Chavez that a woman of her age doesn't need to worry about being raped." So National Review’s John J. Miller and Ramesh Ponnuru revealed in their Washington Bulletin e-mail on Monday.

Here’s the transcript of the relevant portion of the show as provided by National Review, with some slight corrections and added words I got off the MRC’s taped copy of the program:

Linda Chavez, Center for Equal Opportunity: "If you're someone like me, who lives out in a rural area -- if someone breaks into my house and wants to murder or rape me or steal all of my property, it'll take half an hour for a policeman to get to me."..

Bonnie Erbe: "And if you look at the statistics, I would bet that you have a greater chance of being struck by lightning, Linda, than living where you live, and at your age, being raped."

Get ready for the 'Mother of all Bubbles,' the Bailout Bubble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<POST>
<POSTER> Greg Bacon </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> 2009-08-12T00:00:00 </POSTDATE>
Entering the Greatest Depression in History

Gerald Celente, the head of the Trends Research Institute, the major trend-forecasting agency in the world, wrote in May of 2009 of the “bailout bubble.” Celente’s forecasts are not to be taken lightly, as he accurately predicted the 1987 stock market crash, the fall of the Soviet Union, the 1998 Russian economic collapse, the 1997 East Asian economic crisis, the 2000 Dot-Com bubble burst, the 2001 recession, the start of a recession in 2007 and the housing market collapse of 2008, among other things.
On May 13, 2009, Celente released a Trend Alert, reporting that, “The biggest financial bubble in history is being inflated in plain sight,” and that, “This is the Mother of All Bubbles, and when it explodes [...] it will signal the end to the boom/bust cycle that has characterized economic activity throughout the developed world.” Further, “This is much bigger than the Dot-com and Real Estate bubbles which hit speculators, investors and financiers the hardest. However destructive the effects of these busts on employment, savings and productivity, the Free Market Capitalist framework was left intact. But when the 'Bailout Bubble' explodes, the system goes with it.”

Celente further explained that, “Phantom dollars, printed out of thin air, backed by nothing ... and producing next to nothing ... defines the ‘Bailout Bubble.’ Just as with the other bubbles, so too will this one burst. But unlike Dot-com and Real Estate, when the "Bailout Bubble" pops, neither the President nor the Federal Reserve will have the fiscal fixes or monetary policies available to inflate another.”

As the Financial Times reported in late July of 2009, while the Fed and Treasury hail the efforts and impact of the bailouts, “Neil Barofsky, special inspector-general for the troubled asset relief programme, [TARP] said that the various US schemes to shore up banks and restart lending exposed federal agencies to a risk of $23,700bn [$23.7 trillion] – a vast estimate that was immediately dismissed by the Treasury.” The inspector-general of the TARP program stated that there were “fundamental vulnerabilities . . . relating to conflicts of interest and collusion, transparency, performance measures, and anti-money laundering.”

In other words, the IG of TARP says the system is being looted from within and cronies in on the theft are protecting one another and buying off Congress to look the other way or hold some lame-ass hearing that gets nowhere, nor does it find anything out about where the money got off to, but it gives Congressional crooks camera face time to look stern, act and talk tough.

Why, they might even get indignant and wave a naughty finger at the crooks..

Obama's Pick to Lead Afghan War, Lieutenant General Stanley McChrystal Linked to Abuse of Prisoners & Secret Assassination Unit

AMY GOODMAN: Your thoughts on this hearing last week? What questions weren’t asked?

TOM ENGELHARDT: Well, I think you have to actually go beyond the issue of mistreatment of detainees, because they were being mistreated for a reason. What General McChrystal was involved in was, if you remember the Vietnam era, a kind of a mini Phoenix Program. It was a massive targeted assassination program. Bob Woodward, with some exaggeration, referred to it as the equivalent of a Manhattan Project for Iraq. Seymour Hersh has said that it was an executive assassination wing being run out of the Vice President’s office. And we don’t know. It was very secret, so we don’t know how many people were killed. Possibly hundreds. And we’re talking here—Al McCoy, who’s an expert on torture, says this wasn’t boots on the ground; this was bullets in the head.

And I think, rather than counterinsurgency, this guy is being brought into Afghanistan to run an already dark war, and he really comes from the dark side.

And I think, you know, what we might expect is that they— we have news now that they’re bringing a thousand new Special Forces people—Special Operations people into Afghanistan. That’s about 5,000. He’s bringing two Special Operations people, generals, from Washington with him. I think we could well see another massive assassination campaign in Afghanistan. I think that’s what this could mean. And I think that’s one of the things that we really do have to think about and look out for...

But we do know that this guy really—he is a legacy figure from the worst of the Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld era.

Winning hearts and minds by blowing apart bodies

The war is expanding at several levels, and the—I mean, he may bring a powerful—this is McChrystal—a powerful targeted assassination campaign on the ground. We already have a targeted assassination campaign in the air, going on, you know, twenty-four hours a day, because we have these CIA-run drone aircraft that are flown from we don’t know where, probably somewhere in the United States, over the Pakistani tribal areas. Reports from those areas—and we can’t—you know, reporters basically don’t get into them—indicate very high casualty levels of non-targeted people. And this is—I’ve always said that strikes like this are not a war on terror but a war for terror, because they create—they create enemies, they create terror.

The Salvador Option and the "DICK, Cheney, an assassination program that goes back to the days of the Vietnam War.

In April of 2005, the Council on Foreign Relations wrote that Stuart Herrington recently visited Iraq as a counterinsurgency consultant to the Pentagon, and they quoted Herrington as saying, "when I was [in Iraq], I favored using Shiites and Kurds to go after the Sunnis." They also wrote that Reuel Marc Gerecht confirms that death squads, consisting of Kurdish and Shia commando teams, have been assembled to go after Sunni insurgent leaders , and quoted Gerecht as saying, "[The Pentagon] is trying to expand these units and deploy them more aggressively."

Bonus Section: General McChrystal is the same general that helped cover up the assassination of U.S. Army Ranger Pat Tillman, the former football star who signed up after 9/11 and was sent to Afghanistan where he quickly became disillusioned in that war, telling friends that when he returned home on leave the next week, he was going to give interviews telling Americans they were fighting the wrong war.
The Pentagon freaked upon learning this, since Tillman had been their "Golden Boy" for recruiting and PR. So Pat was silenced with three bullets to the forehead in what was first said to be the result of enemy fire.
Which then changed to a "friendly fire" casualty, all that fog of war stuff.

"Army medical examiners were suspicious about the close proximity of the three bullet holes in Pat Tillman's forehead and tried without success to get authorities to investigate whether the former NFL player's death amounted to a crime, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press.

"'The medical evidence did not match up with the, with the scenario as described,' a doctor who examined Tillman's body after he was killed on the battlefield in Afghanistan in 2004 told investigators.

"The doctors – whose names were blacked out – said that the bullet holes were so close together that it appeared the Army Ranger was cut down by an M-16 fired from a mere 10 yards or so away."

Three taps to the forehead is a targeted hit, not a mistake. And the Tillman family have been getting LIED to by the White House, Congress and the Pentagon since Day One.

Why?

Anti-war British MP Galloway kept out of Canada
Providing food to 'enemy' children is terrorism according to zionists

Find your Member of Parliament by Postal Code

Friday, March 20th, 2009 ~ctvtoronto.ca

var byString = ""; var sourceString = "ctvtoronto.ca"; if ((sourceString != "") && (byString != "")) { document.write(byString + ", "); } else { document.writ Controversial British MP George Galloway has been denied admission to Canada to speak at a Toronto anti-war conference, and a spokesman for Immigration Minister Jason Kenney says the minister won't intervene.
"The minister will not give a special exemption from Canada's security laws to Mr. Galloway, nor will he provide special treatment to a man who brags about giving 'financial support' to Hamas, a banned terrorist organization in Canada, or who offers sympathy for Canada's enemies in Afghanistan," Alykhan Velshi told CTV News in a statement on Friday.

"I'm sure Mr. Galloway has a large Rolodex of friends in regimes elsewhere in the world willing to roll out the red carpet for him. Canada, however, won't be one of them."

Galloway was to speak at a March 30 conference called Resisting War from Gaza to Kandahar , an event being put on by the Toronto Coalition to Stop the War before making other speaking stops in Mississauga, Ottawa and Montreal. He also has an American tour planned.

Galloway issued a statement saying " this idiotic ban shames Canada. " He called it "a very sad day for the Canada we have known and loved.

"All right-thinking Canadians, whether they agree with me over the wisdom of sending troops to Afghanistan or not, will oppose this outrageous decision," he said. "On a personal note, for a Scotsman to be barred from Canada is like being told to stay away from the family home ."

Velshi said border security officials deemed Galloway to be inadmissible under Section 34(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. That act deals with excluding those who provide material support for terrorism.

Galloway helped lead an aid convoy into the Gaza Strip after Israel's incursion there earlier this winter to take on Hamas fighters who had been launching rockets into Israel.

The Canadian Jewish Congress quickly issued a statement commending the government for its decision.

"We applaud the Canadian government for keeping George Galloway, a man who thrives on his support of terrorists, out of Canada," said CJC Co-President Sylvain Abitbol.

"George Galloway publicly brags about his moral and, in some cases financial, support for internationally recognized terrorist organizations including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Taliban. He proudly flaunts his own nation's laws and dares Western states to prosecute him for his support of terrorists. He is clearly a risk to Canadians," he added.

B'nai Brith Canada also endorsed the govenrment's action.

Supporters of Galloway pronounced themselves outraged.

" This is a full frontal attack on free speech in Canada , and one that all supporters of civil liberties must challenge ," the coalition's James Clark said in a statement.

"Kenney's ban is an unprecedented move to censor someone whose views are critical of our own government's foreign policy. We will not accept this ban, and we plan on challenging it."

Political reaction

In Winnipeg, Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said he didn't agree with Galloway's views.

"We let into Canada all kinds of people who say ridiculous and absurd things and Galloway has said his share of ridiculous and absurd things. The issue ... is whether the security services know something about George Galloway that I don't," he said.

" The minister of immigration is becoming the minister of censorship ," NDP immigration critic Olivia Chow said. "We don't have to agree with everything Mr. Galloway talks about.

" But, at bare minimum, they should be allowed to express their points of view so Canadians can make decisions themselves. This is pure censorship and it's wrong. "

Galloway in Canada

Galloway has been an outspoken opponent of the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq. The British Labour party kicked him out in 2003 for his stance, but he won re-election in 2005 under his Respect party banner.

In 2004, Galloway won a libel case against the Daily Telegraph newspaper, which had alleged in April 2003 that Galloway had received money from the Iraqi regime of then-dictator Saddam Hussein.

Speaking at a 2005 conference in Mississauga organized by two Islamic groups, Galloway called on Canada to withdraw from Afghanistan.

"Canada has sent an army of 1,000 soldiers to occupy the Muslim country of Afghanistan (and ships to the Persian Gulf),'' Galloway said.

"Your ships in the Gulf and your soldiers in Afghanistan are doing the dirty work of George W. Bush and Tony Blair. They are freeing American ships and soldiers to go to Fallujah and massacre the people of Iraq.''

Also in 2005, a panel of U.S. senators grilled Galloway over the allegations he had accepted bribes from the regime of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.

But Galloway gave as good as he got in what many saw as a bravura performance.

"I have never seen a barrel of oil, owned one, bought one, sold one, and neither has anybody on my behalf," he told then-Sen. Norm Coleman, R-Minn.

"Now, you have nothing on me, senator, except my name on lists of names from Iraq, many of which have been drawn up after the installation of your puppet government in Baghdad."

"I know that standards have slipped in Washington in recent years, but for a lawyer, you're remarkably cavalier with any idea of justice," Galloway said.

"I gave my heart and soul to stop you committing the disaster that you did commit in invading Iraq ... senator, in everything I said about Iraq, I turned out to be right and you turned out to be wrong."

However, the lower house of Britain's parliament suspended Galloway for 18 days in 2007 after a committee found circumstantial evidence that a charity set up by the MP had been partly funded by Hussein's regime.

Were Iraq's oil for food program funds not being held in NYC by the jews?

ARREST THEM
4 arrested outside Bush's speaking engagement in Calgary Tuesday, March 17th, 2009

Four people were arrested in downtown Calgary on Tuesday during a protest outside the building where former U.S. president George W. Bush was making his first official speech since leaving office.

Two men were charged with obstructing a peace officer and resisting arrest. Another man was charged with breaching the peace, while the fourth was issued a ticket for violating a public behaviour bylaw, said Duty Insp. Rob Williams of Calgary police.

Bush addressed an invitation-only crowd of about 1,500 at the Telus Convention Centre in his first speech since leaving office. Tickets were reported to cost $400 per person. Media were not allowed inside.

About 200 protesters crowded around the entrance of the convention centre in the morning, heckling ticket holders and chanting "go home."

"I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to publicly voice my displeasure with the American foreign policy" under Bush, said Jeff Gaillus, who was carrying a rod with a shoe at the end of it. "I'm not sure what he has to tell us to shed wisdom on the future of the planet."
'The criminal is inside'
One protester, who told CBC News he was "making a statement," tossed a plastic flip-flop sandal, which hit a building. Police handcuffed him and put him inside a police van, saying he was going to be ticketed. (levied?)

"What are you doing arresting that man? The criminal is inside," shouted a protester while others chanted, "Let him go."

Several people used shoes as props during the protest, a nod to an incident in December 2008 in which an Iraqi journalist hurled two shoes at Bush during a news conference in Baghdad. Bush ducked, and the shoes never made contact with their target.

Nevertheless, the journalist, Muntazer al-Zaidi, was sentenced last week to three years in prison for assaulting a foreign head of state during an official visit .

A lineup of people holding tickets to the event — the majority wearing business suits — stretched about two city blocks Tuesday morning, but they were inside the building by 1 p.m. MT, a delay of half an hour.

Security was tight as all guests were searched before entering the hall. Calgary police said they assigned a total of 79 officers, including traffic units, to the event.

Only 79 pigs? hey guys

Among those waiting to hear Bush speak were Senator Pamela Wallin, former Alberta energy minister Murray Smith, CBC hockey broadcaster Kelly Hrudey, former Alberta premier Ralph Klein and Calgary aldermen John Mar and Ric McIver.
"You might not agree with eight years of the policies of Bush… but if he is here, might as well hear what he has to say ," said Paul Dhillon, who was waiting in line to go into the event.
After the almost one-hour speech and question-and-answer session, attendees said Bush was candid and warmed the crowd with self-deprecating humour, joking that Calgary was one of the few places that would have him.

"This is my maiden voyage. My first speech since I was the president of the United States, and I couldn't think of a better place to give it than Calgary, Canada," the 43rd U.S. president said to largely friendly audience.

Bush defended his reasons for invading Iraq and Afghanistan as the appropriate approach to spreading democracy.

"He said if we were in his boots in 9/11, a short time after he got in, there was a big demand to do something, and he had to react and he reacted," said George Fink, CEO of Bonterra Oil and Gas.

Bush also touched on the current economic slump, warning against too much government intervention.

"It's the risk takers, not the government, that is going to pull us out of this recession," he told the crowd. "I'm a free trader to the core."

Attendee John Owen said the address was interesting. "You get the sense that he genuinely believes in what he's saying… whether or not you believe or agree with him."

Rumsfeld Appointed Distinguished Fellow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<POSTER> Stern Gang </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> 2007-10-04T00:00:00 </POSTDATE>
Right : Iraqi-President Saddam Hussein greets Donald Rumsfeld, then special envoy of President Ronald Reagan, in Baghdad on December 20, 1983.

Left : Mr Rumsfeld is the embodiment of America’s Iraq failure. Ahead of the invasion he was arrogant, telling the world the US did not really need help to implement its war. Mr Rumsfeld’s policy of “war-lite” and &amp;quot;partisan-heavy&amp;quot; left too few boots on the ground and too many cronies in high office to keep the peace. Mr Rumsfeld should have gone after the Abu Ghraib scandal but Mr Bush remained loyal.

Donald H. Rumsfeld, the former U.S. secretary of defense, who also served as White House chief of staff, U.S. ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. member of Congress, and chief executive officer of two Fortune 500 companies, has been appointed as a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

“ Don Rumsfeld has been involved with the Hoover Institution during my entire tenure as director, beginning in 1989, as a member of the Hoover Board of Overseers, as a member of the executive committee of the board, and as a significant supporter, ” said John Raisian, Hoover director. “ Don has had immense experience in public service and has much to contribute to society as a result. I am pleased that he will spend time during the coming year in thinking, writing, and advising on important matters of public policy. ”
Left : Tony Snow: It's an interesting thing, because I get e-mails all the time, and people say, &amp;quot;We hear about our death counts. We never hear about theirs. Why?&amp;quot;

Donald Rumsfeld: Well, we don't do body counts on other people. And we have certain rules on people we capture, in terms of exposing them to the public, Geneva Conventions and the like.
The Hoover Institution is embarking on bringing together a task force of scholars and experts to focus on issues pertaining to ideology and terror. The nation ’ s experience since September 11, 2001, has provoked new ways of thinking about national security and world peace in a new era. “ I have asked Don to join the distinguished group of scholars that will pursue new insights on the direction of thinking that the United States might consider going forward, ” said Raisian. “ I am delighted that he will participate in the deliberations of our task force. ”
But nearly 2,000 Stanford faculty, students and community members have signed an online petition calling the decision to bring Rumsfeld, 75, to the conservative think tank &amp;quot;fundamentally incompatible with Stanford's ethical values.&amp;quot; Some members of the university's Faculty Senate have called for a resolution in protest.

Rumsfeld, who served as defense secretary twice, from 1975 to 1977 and then again from 2001 to 2006, is a polarizing figure, and debate on the Stanford campus seems polarized, too.

&amp;quot;We think he has distinguished himself for all the wrong things than what the university should stand for and what America should stand for,&amp;quot; psychology professor emeritus Philip Zimbardo told The San Jose Mercury News. &amp;quot;We've never protested before but this seems to be egregious.&amp;quot;

Hoover Institution Public Affairs Manager Michele Horaney declined to comment but said Stanford faculty are entitled to their opinions.

Rumsfeld is to work on a task force on terrorism and ideology alongside other experts and scholars at the institution. It was not announced when his work at the institution would begin.

&amp;quot;Don has had immense experience in public service and has much to contribute to society as a result,&amp;quot; Hoover director John Raisian said in a statement. Rumsfeld previously served on the institution's Board of Overseers.

&amp;quot;It is fair and to have been expected that Rumsfeld's appointment would generate protest,&amp;quot; Wilson School visiting professor Daniel Kurtzer said in an email. &amp;quot;[Rumsfeld] presided over policies and military actions that are quite divisive and which have cost our country dearly in terms of human lives and material resources.&amp;quot; Kurtzer has previously served as U.S. ambassador to Israel and Egypt.

The Hoover Institution has given no sign it will reverse its decision. It dismissed Stanford faculty concerns that Rumsfeld lacks the academic background to warrant a position at the Hoover Institution.

&amp;quot;He's not conducting research, and he doesn't have any kind of a tenured post at all, so I don't know that that's ... a huge concern,&amp;quot; Horaney said.

&amp;quot;The appointment of someone with his background and experience at a university is something that is often done in academia, notwithstanding the lack of academic experience,&amp;quot; Wilson School professor Robert Finn said, citing the example of former German foreign minister Joschka Fischer, who taught in the Wilson School last year. Finn himself is a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan.

The strident opposition to Rumsfeld's appointment contrasts with the silence that met other fellows with ties to the Bush administration when they joined the Hoover Institution. General John Abizaid, for example, became a fellow after retiring as commander of U.S. Central Command this year.

Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice served as provost at Stanford for six years in the 1990s. She is also on leave from her position as senior fellow at Hoover but has said she plans to return, a move that may stir more controversy.

President Bush attempted to visit Hoover last year, but his motorcade was blocked by more than 1,000 protestors. His meeting was relocated to a site off-campus.

The Petition Against Donald Rumsfeld

To: Stanford University Community

We, the undersigned members of the Stanford community, strongly object to the appointment of Donald Rumsfeld as a &amp;quot;distinguished visiting fellow&amp;quot; at Stanford's Hoover Institution. We view the appointment as fundamentally incompatible with the ethical values of truthfulness, tolerance, disinterested enquiry, respect for national and international laws, and care for the opinions, property and lives of others to which Stanford is inalienably committed.

Sincerely,

Idiocracy in America - reinforcement of corrupted values at Louisiana State Legislature permitting filth to proliferate in name of "multiculturalism"

Louisiana is a pathetic state for allowing this to happen. Where is legislative priority, common sense and responsibility?

Such proliferation of filth in public, let alone in the supposedly serious legislature, demonstrates the decline of Western civilization.

Exactly what Zionist Jews want by promoting the corrupted and bad values to condone & encourage irresponsible, promiscuous, misogynistic, misandric, militant homosexual, criminal and self-destructive behavior in the West.

Every nation the swarm of Zionist Jew locusts invade turn to proverbial shit, and the result is clear.

Zionist Jews know that, revering the sinister wisdom of the Talmud and Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the most effective method of cultural & racial destruction is spreading media propaganda extolling the benefits of integration in unmitigated multiculturalism & open immigration policy to render the native population brainwashed and docile for complete conquest by control, terrorism and theft of public treasure.

This is the product of Zionist Jew mind-f*ck.

NAACP, SPLC & ADL Kosher approved.

Idiocracy mash-up

Partners In Crime By Zeyad

August 07, 2009 "Healing Iraq" -- There is little to no coverage of this, but these eight young men were the security guards of the Zuwiyya branch of al-Rafidain Bank at the Jadiriya district of Baghdad. The small bank is located just across the river from the Green Zone and a few hundred yards away from the residences of Hakim, Adil Abdul Mahdi and Badr Brigade (now members of the Presidential Brigade) checkpoints.

WARNING Video contains disturbing Images and should only be viewed by a mature audience

They were tied up and killed execution-style by a group of officers who were members of Vice President Adil Abdul Mahdi's security detail on their own turf in Jadiriya. The incident was carried out on July 28 after midnight. A huge portion of the stolen money ($4.5 million) was then located at the offices of al-'Adala (justice) newspaper (which, as you guessed, is owned by Abdul Mahdi).

In fact it turns out that the two officers who were in charge of the heist were not arrested but have already fled Iraq (who helped them flee?).

PM Maliki has stepped in to cover up for his partners in crime once more, and all public debate of the incident has been stifled. Iraqis seem to have been shocked by the brutal crime and its implications but nothing more than that. The outrage of a few brave journalists ended just two days after the incident, and now everyone is warning against rushing to conclusions or using the incident as an excuse to defame our politicians and "Islamic symbols" (whatever that means).

Israel seems to be determined to continue its psychological and media warfare against Lebanon, three years on its defeat in the Second Lebanon War. Israeli bullying also seems to be a part of turning the International concern away from building its illegal settlements in occupied Jerusalem and the West Bank in a defiant move to the international community in general and the United States in particular.

On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave an assertive message to Beirut, saying, "Let it be clear that the Lebanese government will be held responsible for any attack on Israel coming from its territory."

The Israeli prime minister spoke before Gush Katif evacuees in Hevel Lachish in southern occupied territories.

Netanyahu addressed the shifting politics in Lebanon, and said, "If Hezbollah entered the government as an official body, let it be clear that the Lebanese government will be held responsible for any attack on Israel coming from its territory. The moment they are part of the government, the sovereign Lebanese government is responsible. I hope we will not need such responses."

On Sunday, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Daniel Ayalon told Yedioth Ahronoth that should any attempt be made on an Israeli official the Lebanese government would be held accountable. "Hezbollah is not on the moon, its part of the Lebanese government…. if so much as one hair on the head of any Israeli overseas – official or tourist – is harmed, we will hold Hezbollah responsible and the response would be harsh."

Ayalon's statements were made in the context of a report in Egyptian media Saturday night that Egyptian security forces had uncovered a plot to murder Israeli Ambassador Shalom Cohen, although Hezbollah was not mentioned in the report.

An Egyptian judicial source meanwhile denied in statements to AFP that the suspects had mentioned any plans to murder Cohen during their interrogation.

Israeli Northern Command chief Brigadier-General Alon Friedman said in an interview to the British Times last week that the quiet on the northern border "could erupt any minute".

He added that the stability between Lebanon and the Zionist entity was "in danger". According to the report, Hezbollah has accumulated over 40,000 rockets and has been training its troops to launch rockets capable of reaching Tel Aviv as well as airplanes.

In 1982, Israel claimed that the Palestinian resistance tried to assassinate its Ambassador in London, Shlomo Argov, and took it as a pretext to invade Lebanon and occupy its south for the next 18 years. Revelations and analyses have confirmed that Israel was behind the ‘failed’ assassination bid to justify its deadly invasion of Lebanon to eliminate the Palestinian resistance.

Netanyahu also addressed the matter of the Gaza evacuees and their location in eastern Lachish. "We are committed to completing our work, and part of it is ensuring that the territories across the border are not used as launch bases against us. Every attack will yield a response," he said.

Last week, US Middle East envoy George Mitchell has asked Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak for a "deposit," an advance commitment of a one-year freeze on construction in occupied West Bank settlements.

He argued that the Arab states will not make gestures toward normalization with Israel without a guarantee of an end to building in the settlements. Mitchell said an Israeli agreement to temporarily freeze construction would facilitate “concessions” from the Arab states.

An Israeli senior source noted that while Netanyahu and Barak did not reject the request, they disagree with the Americans over some of the details. Mitchell asked for a construction freeze of at least a year, but Israel has agreed to suspend building on the settlements for six months, at most.

The Americans have not yet said clearly what will happen at the end of the freeze period. Israel wants a U.S. commitment to reach new understandings with Tel Aviv over future developments that would be similar to those between former president George W. Bush and former prime minister Ehud Olmert.

Israel and the U.S. also disagree over the future of 2,500 illegal housing units already under construction in the settlements. Israel wants to complete all of these units, while Mitchell seeks to reduce the number to be completed as much as possible.

Moreover, French Foreign Ministry questioned last month Israeli Ambassador Daniel Shek, and demanded immediate end to Israeli settlement building 'including in east Jerusalem'. Shek also told that 'Israel should open checkpoints regularly to allow reconstruction of Gaza'.

No Says Taleban To Karzai Talks

Taleban shun Karzai talks offer

A spokesman for Taleban militants in Afghanistan has rejected another offer for talks by President Hamid Karzai. Spokesman Qari Yusuf Ahmadi said the Taleban would never negotiate with the Afghan authorities while foreign troops remained in the country.

President Karzai repeated on Saturday that he would be willing to offer the Taleban positions in government if it would bring peace.

&amp;quot;Taliban are not interested in government posts - ministries or anything. We want the withdrawal of foreign forces and we stand by our position,&amp;quot; Qari Yusuf Ahmadi told news agencies.

&amp;quot;As long as they have not withdrawn, we'll never talk with the Kabul administration.&amp;quot;

President Karzai said on Saturday he wished he could contact Taleban leader Mullah Omar and warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to ask why they were trying to destroy Afghanistan. He said he would meet both men personally, and even offer them cabinet posts, if it would help to bring about peace. But he reiterated he would not agree to any troop
withdrawal.
Left : A Taleban suicide bomber killed 30 people on Saturday

The Taleban claimed responsibility for Saturday's suicide bomb attack on a Kabul bus, which was split in two by the blast. The attack, in which a further 21 people were injured, was the second deadliest in the Afghan capital since 2001.

The Afghani people have renewed confidence in the Taleban as civic services wither, security worsens and air strikes carried out by international troops deployed in the country continue to kill civilians. Foreign air forces bombard villages and sometimes Mosques in the hope of killing Taleban militants,

In July, 2007, over 130 dead bodies of civilians including women and children were found in the rubble left by coalition bombardment.

The civilian casualties in that incident became even higher as the search for dead bodies continued. Some estimates put the total loss of life at over 180 persons. But, as US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld said, &amp;quot;we don't do body counts.&amp;quot; Moreover, it is difficult to independently, verify the death toll in these incidents as the bombings occur in remote and volatile regions of the country.

About 37,000 soldiers of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and 13,000 US-led coalition troops are operating in Afghanistan to hunt down militants. However, they have frequently caused high civilian casualties in their operations, critically undermining the Afghan people's support for them.

Nevertheless, foreign forces have asserted that Taleban insurgents deliberately mingle themselves with civilians therefore, civilian casualties are caused. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has severely criticized foreign troops this year for their lack of coordination with Afghan forces during their operations and the high loss of life among civilians.

Due to rising Taliban insurgency, over 3,000 persons, most of whom are Taleban militants, have been killed in Afghanistan this year. Scores of Taleban fighters have been killed in the past week. However, there seems to be an endless supply of young Paskiistani and Afghani young men who want to take up arms and are willing to die to liberate Afghanistan from the seven-year occupation.

Never mind the countless millions of innocent people who die for your egos and iniquity, they're just amalek anyway .

In 2002 Ben Bernanke (then a Federal Reserve governor, today the chairman of the Board of Governors) made this startling admission in a speech given in honor of Friedman’s 90th birthday: “I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression, you’re right.

israel's medical profession does not condemn the illegal organ trade.

By Donald Boström

You could call me a 'matchmaker,' said Levy Izhak Rosenbaum, from Brooklyn, USA, in a secret recording with an FBI-agent whom he believed to be a client. Ten days later, at the end of July this year, Rosenbaum was arrested and a vast, Sopranos-like, imbroglio of money-laundering and illegal organ-trade was revealed. Rosenbaum’s matchmaking had nothing to do with romance. It was all about buying and selling kidneys from Israel on the black market. Rosenbaum says that he buys the kidneys for $10,000, from poor people. He then proceeds to sell the organs to desperate patients in the States for $160,000. The accusations have shaken the American transplantation business. If they are true it means that organ trafficking is documented for the first time in the US, experts tell the New Jersey Real-Time News.

On the question of how many organs he has sold Rosenbaum replies: “Quite a lot. And I have never failed,” he boasts. The business has been running for quite some time. Francis Delmonici, professor of transplant surgery at Harvard and member of the National Kidney Foundation’s Board of Directors, tells the same newspaper that organ-trafficking, similar to the one reported from Israel, is carried out in other places of the world as well. 5–6,000 operations a year, about ten per cent of the world’s kidney transplants are carried out illegally, according to Delmonici.

Countries suspected of these activities are Pakistan, the Philippines and China, where the organs are allegedly taken from executed prisoners. But Palestinians also harbor strong suspicions against Israel for seizing young men and having them serve as the country’s organ reserve – a very serious accusation, with enough question marks to motivate the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to start an investigation about possible war crimes.

Israel has repeatedly been under fire for its unethical ways of dealing with organs and transplants. France was among the countries that ceased organ collaboration with Israel in the nineties. Jerusalem Post wrote that “the rest of the European countries are expected to follow France’s example shortly.”

Half of the kidneys transplanted to Israelis since the beginning of the 2000s have been bought illegally from Turkey, Eastern Europe or Latin America. Israeli health authorities have full knowledge of this business but do nothing to stop it. At a conference in 2003 it was shown that Israel is the only western country with a medical profession that doesn’t condemn the illegal organ trade. The country takes no legal measures against doctors participating in the illegal business – on the contrary, chief medical officers of Israel’s big hospitals are involved in most of the illegal transplants, according to Dagens Nyheter (December 5, 2003).

In the summer of 1992, Ehud Olmert, then minister of health, tried to address the issue of organ shortage by launching a big campaign aimed at having the Israeli public register for post mortem organ donation. Half a million pamphlets were spread in local newspapers. Ehud Olmert himself was the first person to sign up. A couple of weeks later the Jerusalem Post reported that the campaign was a success. No fewer than 35,000 people had signed up. Prior to the campaign it would have been 500 in a normal month. In the same article, however, Judy Siegel, the reporter, wrote that the gap between supply and demand was still large. 500 people were in line for a kidney transplant, but only 124 transplants could be performed. Of 45 people in need of a new liver, only three could be operated on in Israel.

While the campaign was running, young Palestinian men started to disappear from villages in the West Bank and Gaza. After five days Israeli soldiers would bring them back dead, with their bodies ripped open.

Talk of the bodies terrified the population of the occupied territories. There were rumors of a dramatic increase of young men disappearing, with ensuing nightly funerals of autopsied bodies.

I was in the area at the time, working on a book. On several occasions I was approached by UN staff concerned about the developments. The persons contacting me said that organ theft definitely occurred but that they were prevented from doing anything about it. On an assignment from a broadcasting network I then travelled around interviewing a great number of Palestinian families in the West Bank and Gaza – meeting parents who told of how their sons had been deprived of organs before being killed. One example that I encountered on this eerie trip was the young stone-thrower Bilal Achmed Ghanan.

It was close to midnight when the motor roar from an Israeli military column sounded from the outskirts of Imatin, a small village in the northern parts of the West Bank. The two thousand inhabitants were awake. They were still, waiting, like silent shadows in the dark, some lying upon roofs, others hiding behind curtains, walls, or trees that provided protection during the curfew but still offered a full view toward what would become the grave for the first martyr of the village. The military had interrupted the electricity and the area was now a closed-off military zone – not even a cat could move outdoors without risking its life. The overpowering silence of the dark night was only interrupted by quiet sobbing. I don’t remember if our shivering was due to the cold or to the tension. Five days earlier, on May 13, 1992, an Israeli special force had used the village’s carpentry workshop for an ambush. The person they were assigned to put out of action was Bilal Achmed Ghanan, one of the stone-throwing Palestinian youngsters who made life difficult for the Israeli soldiers.

As one of the leading stone-throwers Bilal Ghanan had been wanted by the military for a couple of years. Together with other stone-throwing boys he hid in the Nablus mountains, with no roof over his head. Getting caught meant torture and death for these boys – they had to stay in the mountains at all costs.

On May 13 Bilal made an exception, when for some reason, he walked unprotected past the carpentry workshop. Not even Talal, his older brother, knows why he took this risk. Maybe the boys were out of food and needed to restock.

Everything went according to plan for the Israeli special force. The soldiers stubbed their cigarettes, put away their cans of Coca-Cola, and calmly aimed through the broken window. When Bilal was close enough they needed only to pull the triggers. The first shot hit him in the chest. According to villagers who witnessed the incident he was subsequently shot with one bullet in each leg. Two soldiers then ran down from the carpentry workshop and shot Bilal once in the stomach. Finally, they grabbed him by his feet and dragged him up the twenty stone steps of the workshop stair. Villagers say that people from both the UN and the Red Crescent were close by, heard the discharge and came to look for wounded people in need of care. Some arguing took place as to who should take care of the victim. Discussions ended with Israeli soldiers loading the badly wounded Bilal in a jeep and driving him to the outskirts of the village, where a military helicopter waited. The boy was flown to a destination unknown to his family. Five days later he came back, dead and wrapped in green hospital fabric.

A villager recognized Captain Yahya, the leader of the military column who had transported Bilal from the postmortem center Abu Kabir, outside of Tel Aviv, to the place for his final rest. “Captain Yahya is the worst of them all,” the villager whispered in my ear. After Yahya had unloaded the body and changed the green fabric for a light cotton one, some male relatives of the victim were chosen by the soldiers to do the job of digging and mixing cement.

Together with the sharp noises from the shovels we could hear laughter from the soldiers who, as they waited to go home, exchanged some jokes. As Bilal was put in the grave his chest was uncovered. Suddenly it became clear to the few people present just what kind of abuse the boy had been exposed to. Bilal was not by far the first young Palestinian to be buried with a slit from his abdomen up to his chin.

The families in the West Bank and in Gaza felt that they knew exactly what had happened: “Our sons are used as involuntary organ donors,” relatives of Khaled from Nablus told me, as did the mother of Raed from Jenin and the uncles of Machmod and Nafes from Gaza, who had all disappeared for a number of days only to return at night, dead and autopsied.

“Why are they keeping the bodies for up to five days before they let us bury them? What happened to the bodies during that time? Why are they performing autopsy, against our will, when the cause of death is obvious? Why are the bodies returned at night? Why is it done with a military escort? Why is the area closed off during the funeral? Why is the electricity interrupted?” Nafe’s uncle was upset and he had a lot of questions.

The relatives of the dead Palestinians no longer harbored any doubts as to the reasons for the killings, but the spokesperson for the Israeli army claimed that the allegations of organ theft were lies. All the Palestinian victims go through autopsy on a routine basis, he said. Bilal Achmed Ghanem was one of 133 Palestinians killed in various ways that year. According to the Palestinian statistics the causes of death were: shot in the street, explosion, tear gas, deliberately run over, hanged in prison, shot in school, killed at home etcetera. The 133 people killed were between four months to 88 years old. Only half of them, 69 victims, went through postmortem examination. The routine autopsy of killed Palestinians – of which the army spokesperson was talking – has no bearing on the reality in the occupied territories. The questions remain.

We know that Israel has a great need for organs, that there is a vast and illegal trade of organs which has been running for many years now, that the authorities are aware of it and that doctors in managing positions at the big hospitals participate, as well as civil servants at various levels. We also know that young Palestinian men disappeared, that they were brought back after five days, at night, under tremendous secrecy, stitched back together after having been cut from abdomen to chin.

It’s time to bring clarity to this macabre business, to shed light on what is going on and what has taken place in the territories occupied by Israel since the Intifada began.

Jewish exploitation of the generosity of their Gentile neighbors is not a new phenomenon. Jews are in fact taught to deceive their neighbors, to spread plagues upon them, to steal from them, and to enslave them. The Jews are told that their ancestors played on the kindness of the Egyptians and borrowed their gold and silver, then stole it when they fled the nation. Exodus chapter 11 states..

Before considering the idea to legalize the selling of alcohol before noon on Sundays, I would like to give you something in which to ponder. Having come from a home in which alcohol was used as frequently as water by my parent, and watching it destroy my mother's body and the lives of my other brothers, I have firsthand experience what alcohol can do. It is destructive.

I would like to personally ask Deanna McLaughlin to walk a mile in my shoes. I was a small child that was beaten, cursed at, went to bed hungry and often saw my mother sexually assaulted, all for the cause of alcohol. I watched my mother bleed to death because her liver was ate up by the poison of alcohol.

Many mothers and fathers have cried as their children have been injured or died at the hand of an alcoholic driver.

I ask Mrs. McLaughlin to reconsider her request. If she or others wish to purchase alcohol, then why not buy it on Saturday? The "revenue" will be from that day of sales.

In case anyone doesn't know this, I must remind you that Sunday is a day the Gentiles have dedicated to the worship of the Lord. Our own Lord said that it is to be a "holy" day.

America has so much to answer for already, why not at least honor the Lord by not legalizing the sale of alcohol before noon on Sundays.

Victoria Beckham has been photographed with a new Hebrew tattoo thought to be inked to celebrate her ten-year anniversary with footballer husband David. More photos at this link.

The tattoo, which translates as "Together, forever, eternally", was seen as she recorded her guest spot on the panel of American Idol .

Victoria and David previously inked matching Hebrew tattoos quoting a verse from King Solomon's Song Of Songs , which translated as: "I am for my beloved and my beloved is for me."

Last year, Victoria was said to be "furious" at David's decision to get another tattoo on his arm, a Hebrew proverb that read: "My son, do not forget my teaching but keep my commands in your heart."
David has previously described himself as "half Jewish" as his maternal grandfather Joseph West was Jewish

India's Indigenous March On Delhi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<POST>

<POSTDATE> 2007-10-02T00:00:00 </POSTDATE>
Thousands of landless farmers and tribal people in India are setting out on a massive protest march to the capital, Delhi.

The march begins on a national holiday marking the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, the man who introduced the idea of non-violent protest to the nation.

It is intended to raise awareness about land rights and due to last for nearly four weeks.

The organisers hope 25,000 people will take part in the march. E SF

Thousands of people began gathering in the city of Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh, chanting and singing. Most of them are low caste and landless labourers or tribal people demanding legal rights over their land.

They are calling for a national authority to oversee land reform and a system of fast track courts to deal with the long delays in resolving land disputes.

Land reform is a huge issue in rural India. The system is often corrupt and unjust.

So over the next few weeks these protestors will walk more than 300km (180 miles) to Delhi, where their leaders hope to meet, among others, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

It is a huge logistical exercise.

Those taking part are being broken down into groups of one thousand, to make sure everyone gets fed.

The march has been dubbed Janadesh - People's Verdict - and it is described as non-violent civil disobedience.

Indigenous Peoples in India

While the government of India refers to indigenous peoples as &amp;quot;Scheduled Tribes&amp;quot;, Adivasi has become the popular term for India's indigenous or tribal peoples. It is a Sanskrit word meaning &amp;quot;original people&amp;quot;. Contrary to the official government position, this term reflects the widely recognised fact that the people in question are the earliest known settlers on the Indian subcontinent and North-East India. The indigenous or tribal peoples of India's north-eastern region (the seven states Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura) do not call themselves, nor are they normally referred to in literature, as Adivasi in spite of the fact that the meaning of the term very much applies to the respective people. Representatives of these peoples prefer to use the English term &amp;quot;indigenous peoples&amp;quot;.

Population

Left : People: Tangkhul Naga

In the 2001 census, 84.33 million persons were classified as members of Scheduled Tribes, corresponding to 8.2% of the total population. The census lists 461 groups recognised as tribes, while estimates of the number of tribes living in India reach up to 635. While the number of members of the largest tribes, such as the Gonds, Santals, Oraon, Bhils or Nagas go into the millions others, such as the Onge or the Great Andamanese, are on the brink of extinction.

Below : People Mishmi
The majority of the indigenous and tribal peoples live in an almost contiguous belt stretching from Gujarat in the west to the seven states in the north-east, with the highest concentration in the central region, where more than 50% of the tribal people live. The highest ethnic diversity among the indigenous and tribal population is in the north-eastern region, where 220 distinct groups have been identified. They comprise approximately 12% of the total indigenous population of India.

Agrarian encroachment

Most of India's indigenous peoples have been forest dwellers for centuries. Traditionally, forests met most of their fodder, food, medicinal and other needs. A long process of turning forest areas into a source of revenue and timber, and exploitation of the mineral resources, has led to deforestation, loss of livelihood and displacement of indigenous peoples. The vast majority of the labour force among scheduled tribes is engaged in the agricultural sector (the figure for all India is 66.84%). This means that almost nine-tenths of tribal families rely on natural resources for their livelihood. The majority of these are engaged in permanent agriculture but shifting cultivation still forms the mainstay of the domestic economy in many upland areas, particularly in the north-east. A few small groups in Central and South India and on the Andaman Islands live almost entirely from hunting, gathering and fishing.

Left : People: Naga

Since tribal communities have been forced off most of the fertile plains they previously inhabited, the majority of tribal farmers cultivate marginal land, using rather extensive methods. Above all, irrigation is absent from most areas, the extensive rice terraces of some indigenous peoples, for example some Naga tribes in the north-east, being the exception.

There is a unique relationship between indigenous people and the land. Globilization and subsequent national economic policy has not only displaced 30 million tribal communities and Dalits since Indian independence, but these forces are also using the land in an unsustainable manner, stripping natural resources and destroying local habitat.

DALIT: THE BLACK UNTOUCHABLES OF INDIA

P ossibly the most substantial percentage of Asia's Blacks can be identified among India's 160 million &amp;quot;Untouchables&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Dalits.&amp;quot; Frequently they are called &amp;quot;Outcastes.&amp;quot; Indian nationalist leader and devout Hindu Mohandas K. Gandhi called them &amp;quot;Harijans,&amp;quot; meaning &amp;quot;children of god.&amp;quot; The official name given them in India's constitution (1951) is &amp;quot;Scheduled Castes.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Dalit,&amp;quot; meaning &amp;quot;crushed and broken,&amp;quot; is a name that has come into prominence only within the last four decades. &amp;quot;Dalit&amp;quot; reflects a radically different response to oppression.

The Dalit are demonstrating a rapidly expanding awareness of their African ancestry and their relationship to the struggle of Black people throughout the world. They seem particularly enamored of African-Americans.

African-Americans, in general, seem almost idolized by the Dalit, and the Black Panther Party, in particular, is virtually revered. In April 1972, for example, the Dalit Panther Party was formed in Bombay, India. This organization takes its pride and inspiration directly from the Black Panther Party of the United States. This is a highly important development due to the fact that the Untouchables have historically been so systematically terrorized that many of them, even today, live in a perpetual state of extreme fear of their upper caste oppressors. This is especially evident in the villages.

The formation of the Dalit Panthers and the corresponding philosophy that accompanies it signals a fundamental change in the annals of resistance, and Dalit Panther organizations have subsequently spread to other parts of India. In August 1972, the Dalit Panthers announced that the 25th anniversary of Indian independence would be celebrated as a day of mourning. In 1981, in Bangalore, India Dravidian journalist V.T. Rajshekar published the first issue of Dalit Voice - the major English journal of the Black Untouchables. In a 1987 publication entitled the African Presence in Early Asia, Rajshekar stated that:

&amp;quot;The African-Americans also must know that their liberation struggle cannot be complete as long as their own blood-brothers and sisters living in far off Asia are suffering.

Left : Kanikar people of South India

It is true that African-Americans are also suffering, but our people here today are where African-Americans were two hundred years ago.

African-American leaders can give our struggle tremendous support by bringing forth knowledge of the existence of such a huge chunk of Asian Blacks to the notice of both the American Black masses and the Black masses who dwell within the African continent itself.&amp;quot;

Between the 1940 and 1970, a number of adverse land laws were passed, and much of indigenous land was mortgaged. In 1948, 2.4 million people were evicted from their land. Over a million indigenous people could not obtain any ownership of land, in the ensuing conditions ofpoverty. Many were refused applications to acquire land. The indigenous people were forced into the labour market in order to save money to buy land.

Even with those who were able to buy land, the laws were circumvented to dispossess them -their ownership were usually not acknowledged. No records were made of the land transactions, and land bought has later been found to be surplus or useless land not capable os sustaining life.

In the 1970`s some laws were amended over a 10 year period, giving ample opportunity for the multinational companies to find loop holes in the land legislation, in regards to allowed acreage of land purchases and land use.

Left : People: Siddi

The law now states that the land should be returned to the indigenous tribes however, only a fraction of cases are being investigated. While many complaints are dropped on technicalities; many have been waiting years to be heard. In one area in Maharashtra, only 375 cases resulted in land return to indigenous people, out of 6060 claims.

EXCLUSIVE: Megrahi demands Lockerbie inquiry

By Ian Ferguson and Lucy Adams in Tripoli

The man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing has backed demands for a far-reaching public inquiry into the atrocity, saying the international community owes that to the families of the 270 victims.

In his first full-length interview since being released last week, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi told The Herald: "We all want to know the truth. The truth never dies."

Speaking from a hospital bed at his home in Tripoli, Megrahi talked extensively about his 10-year battle with the Scottish legal system and insisted he did not commit the worst terrorist act on mainland Britain.

The revelation comes in the wake of The Herald's exclusive interview with the son of Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.

Saif al Islam al Gaddafi claimed the proposed prisoner transfer deal with Britain had targeted Megrahi and was linked to talks on trade and oil, but that his release on compassionate grounds was completed unrelated to commerce.

Megrahi, who has terminal prostate cancer, revealed he dropped his appeal against the conviction because he would not live to see its outcome and was desperate to return to his family. "It is all about my family," he said. "People have said there was pressure from the Libyan authorities or Scottish authorities, but it wasn't anything like this."

Instead, he put his faith in an appeal for compassion and said he was impressed by Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill during their meeting at Greenock Prison. "I thought he was a very decent man and he gave me a chance to say what I wanted and to express myself. He gave me the chance to make a presentation to him and he was very polite."

Megrahi is still determined to clear his name, partly through an autobiography, and also backs a public inquiry. Dr Jim Swire, who lost his daughter Flora in the tragedy, has already called for such an investigation, but the UK Government seems firmly opposed.

"I support the issue of a public inquiry if it can be agreed. In my view, it is unfair to the victim's families that this has not been heard. It would help them to know the truth. As I said, the truth never dies.

"If the UK guaranteed it, I would be very supportive. I would want to help Dr Swire and the others with the documents I hold."

However, he added during an hour-long interview: "My feeling is that the UK Government will avoid a public inquiry because it would be a headache for them and the Americans and it would show how much the Americans have been involved and it would also cost them a lot of money which they may not want to spend because of the recession."

Megrahi was vitriolic about the Scottish police and legal system. "I was supposed to receive a fair trial and I was supposed to be subject to fair procedure. From day one of the trial there were delays and delays from the Crown Office. "The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission found at least six grounds of appeal and said there were six grounds on which it may have been a miscarriage of justice.

"From that point we asked the Crown for more documents and more papers. We received only some of them and they were still redacted. Most of the pages were black and I think this is shameful. They were supposed to give us everything."

Referring to the revelation seven years ago that some of the police notebooks recording the aftermath of the tragedy had been destroyed, Megrahi said: "It is very strange that the police forces that dealt with the case - and there were more than 400 officers - it is very strange that many of their notebooks went missing.

When one officer was asked about a notebook, he said it was destroyed. I find this very strange. Surely to destroy the notebooks of so many people is a decision that someone must have been made? This is not fair and is a big question mark about the case."

He said his priority now is to spend time with his five children, the youngest of whom is still of primary school age. "It was always my dream to come back to my family. It was in my prayers every day and when I received the diagnosis, even more so."

A new opinion poll for BBC Scotland has revealed most Scots think Megrahi should have died in jail. It also suggested more than two-thirds of Scots think Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been damaged by the release.

An even bigger majority believe it has had a detrimental effect on the Scottish Government, although more than half of those interviewed thought Mr MacAskill's should not resign. The poll findings emerged as opposition leaders at Westminster pledged to pursue Mr Brown because of his continuing silence.

Tory leader David Cameron said the Prime Minister had to be honest about any dealings with the Libyan government, while Nick Clegg, of the LibDems, demanded that he "come clean".

PALESTINE - Dance of excuses in meters of blood - LIBEL

Children of Israel?
Forestalled forsaken covenant
Thrown down from your false altars,
slain gain each grain
Every meter Eretz Yisrael barometer
Horrendous horde with modern sword

Woe unto you Pharisees, oh hypocrites!
Instead of temples you build tombs
With will never stumble will not succumb
Claim the mantle of the righteous
If we could be in the days of our fathers
You are but prophets who profit from blood

As Rachel mourned for her children
So you butchered Rachel
Six core candles on your false altar
Praying for the next prey to slaughter
Silt Flesh slits and blood of innocents
flows in your flood of guilts
Head bowed at the wailing wall
Dancing steps of death as our tears fall

Babylon reborn house of Satan
From since to senseless to Eden
Manifest destiny
The premise stands
The promised sands
Evil manifests
From the four poles of the earth
Incantations ceremonious rebirth

O' Palestine enthralled
Wail onto Allah
Sing songs of freedom
Chant for liberation
And it shall come to pass
With grace wrest their trespass
from fear and from bondage
To surprise demise and rise
from the yoke of profit prophets
Fret not because of evil doers
The oppressor will cease!
Their golden city deceased!

Rasmiya Odeh was arrested and brought to Moscobiya. Her father, Joseph, and two sisters were detained for interrogation. Joseph Odeh was kept in one room while Rasmiya was beaten nearby. When they brought him to her she was lying on the floor in blood-stained clothes. Her face was blue, her eye black. In his presence, they held her down and shoved a stick into her vagina. One of the interrogators ordered Joseph Odeh “to fuck” his daughter. When he refused they began beating both him and Rasmiya. They again spread her legs and shoved the stick into her. She was bleeding from the mouth, face and vagina when Joseph Odeh fell unconscious.

Photos Obama won't release include images of rape
"At least one picture shows an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner while another is said to show a male translator raping a male detainee.

Further photographs are said to depict sexual assaults on prisoners with objects including a truncheon, wire and a phosphorescent tube."

Hmmm, wonder where the Pentagon got their sick and twisted fantasies of torturing prisoners , sodomizing them with objects like cattle prods and jailing and raping children and denying those being jailed access to an attorney?

Palestinians who have spent time in Israeli detention say the images of sexual abuse and humiliation from Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison are painful reminders of their own experience at the hands of Israeli interrogators.

"Since the beginning of 2003 there has been a sharp rise in the torture, ill treatment, humiliation and incarceration in inhuman conditions of Palestinian detainees by the Shin Bet.''

...Israeli interrogation techniques, including the alleged use of banned techniques such as shabah, in which a prisoner is locked in tight handcuffs and leg irons and forced to sit in a contorted position with a stinking sack over the head and loud music playing nonstop.

The "stinking" sack placed over their heads is one that's been dipped in urine and smeared with excrement.

The Prevalence of Torture By Ralph Schoenman

Chapter 10 excerpted from The Hidden History of Zionism

The Sunday Times study presented the cases of forty-four Palestinians who were tortured. It documented practices in seven centers: prisons within the four principal cities of Nablus, Ramallah, Hebron and Gaza; the interrogation and detention center in Jerusalem known as the Russian Compound or Moscobiya; and special military centers located in Gaza and Sarafand.

The investigation resulted in concrete conclusions: Israeli interrogators routinely ill-treat and torture Arab prisoners. Prisoners are hooded or blindfolded and are hung by their wrists for long periods. Most are struck in the genitals or in other ways sexually abused. Many are sexually assaulted. Others are administered electric shock.

Prisoners are placed in specially constructed “cupboards” two feet square and five feet high with concrete spikes set in the floor. And maltreatment, including “prolonged beatings,” is universal in Israeli prisons and detention centers. Torture is so widespread and systematic, concludes the Sunday Times, that it cannot be dismissed as the work of “rogue cops” exceeding orders. It is sanctioned as deliberate policy and all Israeli security and intelligence services are involved.

Each detention center features interrogators with “apparent predilections.” The Russian Compound [Moscobiya] interrogators in Jerusalem “favor assaults on the genitals , besides endurance tests such as holding a chair with outstretched arms or standing on one leg.”

The specialty of the military center at Sarafand is to blindfold prisoners for long periods, assault them with dogs and hang them by their wrists. The specialty at Ramallah is “anal assault.” Electric shock torture is used almost universally.

Shehadeh Shalaldeh was arrested and interrogated at Moscobiya. A ballpoint refill was pushed into his penis. Abed al-Shalloudi was held without trial for sixteen months. Blindfolded and handcuffed while at Moscobiya, he was beaten by Naim Shabo, an Iraqi Jew, Director of the Minorities Department.

By ALISON WEIR (excerpt)

Israel’s very first, historic heart transplant used a heart removed from a living patient without consent or consulting his family.

In December 1968 a man named Avraham Sadegat (the New York Times seems to give his name as A Savgat) died two days after a stroke, even though his family had been told he was “doing well.”

After initially refusing to release his body, the Israeli hospital where he was being treated finally turned the man’s body over to his family. They discovered that his upper body was wrapped in bandages; an odd situation, they felt, for someone who had suffered a stroke.

When they removed the bandages, they discovered that the chest cavity was stuffed with bandages, and the heart was missing.

During this time, the headline-making Israeli heart transplant had occurred. After their initial shock, the man’s wife and brother began to put the two events together and demanded answers.

The hospital at first denied that Sadegat’s heart had been used in the headline-making transplant, but the family raised a media storm and eventually applied to three cabinet ministers. Finally, weeks later and after the family had signed a document promising not to sue, the hospital admitted that Sadagat’s heart had been used.

The hospital explained that it had abided by Israeli law, which allowed organs to be harvested without the family's consent. (The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime includes the extraction of organs in its definition of human exploitation.)

Indications that the removal of Sadagat’s heart was the actual cause of death went unaddressed.

Director of forensic medicine on missing organs

A 1990 article in the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs entitled “Autopsies and Executions” by Mary Barrett reports on the grotesque killings of young Palestinians. It includes an interview with Dr. Hatem Abu Ghazalch, the former chief health official for the West Bank under Jordanian administration and director of forensic medicine and autopsies.

Barrett asks him about “the widespread anxiety over organ thefts which has gripped Gaza and the West Bank since the intifada began in December of 1987.”

He responded:

"There are indications that for one reason or another, organs, especially eyes and kidneys, were removed from the bodies during the first year or year and a half. There were just too many reports by credible people for there to be nothing happening. If someone is shot in the head and comes home in a plastic bag without internal organs, what will people assume?”

Mysterious Scottish death

In 1998 a Scot named Alisdair Sinclair died under questionable circumstances while in Israeli custody at Ben Gurion airport.

His family was informed of the death and, according to a report in J Weekly , “…told they had three weeks to come up with about $4,900 to fly Sinclair's corpse home. [Alisdair’s brother] says the Israelis seemed to be pushing a different option: burying Sinclair in a Christian cemetery in Israel, at a cost of about $1,300.”

The family scraped up the money, brought the body home, and had an autopsy performed at the University of Glasgow. It turned out that Alisdair’s heart and a tiny throat bone were missing. At this point the British Embassy filed a complaint with Israel.

The J report states:

“A heart said to be Sinclair's was subsequently repatriated to Britain, free of charge. James wanted the [Israeli] Forensic Institute to pay for a DNA test to confirm that this heart was indeed their brother's, but the Institute's director, Professor Jehuda Hiss refused, citing the prohibitive cost, estimated by some sources at $1,500.”
Despite repeated requests from the British Embassy for the Israeli pathologist's and police reports, Israeli officials refused to release either. source

Wall Street execs receiving their multi-million dollar bonuses

Having trouble making ends meet? Trying to decide if you'll pay this month's mortgage or buy groceries?

Fear no more!! Join a Wall Street firm and rake in 7 figure salaries and bonuses!! Don't worry if you're do a shitty job, Uncle Sucker is here to bail you out.

It's a 'Win-Win' situation for Wall Street gangsters who are robbing Americans in broad daylight and being helped by our corrupt Congress and "What, me worry?" attitude of an equally corrupt White House.

Between the Fed shoveling trillions to their insider buds and some of that money making 'aliyah' to Israel and Wall Street robbing pension funds and retirement accounts, it won't be long before we're all living in cardboard shacks while Wall Street fat cats continue eating caviar, drinking $20,000.00 dollar bottles of wine and living in Central Park penthouses.

Report: Bailed-Out Banks Spent $32B in Bonuses in 2008
Citigroup Inc., Merrill Lynch & Co. and seven other U.S. banks paid $32.6 billion in bonuses in 2008 while receiving $175 billion in taxpayer funds , according to a report by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo.
Cuomo analyzed 2008 bonuses at nine banks that received Trouble Asset Relief Program financing from the U.S. government. New York-based Citigroup and Merrill, which has since been taken over by Bank of America Corp., received TARP funding totaling $55 billion, Cuomo said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. paid out a total of $18 billion in bonuses in 2008 while receiving a combined total of $45 billion in taxpayer dollars through TARP. Together, the three firms earned $9.6 billion last year, Cuomo said.

Who's some of these 'Wall Street Piggies?'

Goldman Sachs head Lloyd BLANKFEIN and JPMorgan Chase & Co head James DIMON .

Ok, this is a long speach, but it is really the best account of the US occupation of Iraq that I have come across. Naomi Klein deals with the motives for the occupation - military bases and a free market economy - and tells how the Amercan administration did anything but bring democracy to Iraq. They actually fought every tendency towards democracy in Iraq with everything the had.

It's a fascinating story, and it makes one quite angry. Hopwfully it will make some angry enough to act.

A new activist group in Stockholm has today been able to publish an article in one of Sweden's biggest newspapers about why they go around letting the air out of the tires of big 4WD's in the inner city.

A great initiative if you ask me. I would join the group (they call themselves &amp;quot;Asfaltdjungelns Indianer&amp;quot; (a bit difficult to translate that one - asfalt jungle native americans?) if I had the courage.

The article in swedish is here .

What kind of cars should the environmental activists use that work on a daily basis in the forests? Yes, I know that many SUV's are bought to enlarge some body parts but do they have to empty the tires on all of them? Start with those that have low profile tires :)

Maybe there aren't that many environmental workers in Östermalm but perhaps some SUV owners are just visiting. In Russia they drive Lada's in places where it would be impossible even for SUV's so you really don't have to own a SUV if you work in the forests but it can sure help you a lot.

How environmental friendly are these Google servers that are keeping this blog site up? How much does the manufacturing process of these servers pollute? Shouldn't the Indians go there and pull the plugs ;)

&amp;quot;first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye&amp;quot; ;)

PS. Someone should go and empty this Lada's tires also.

Monbiot and Reducing Climate Change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<POST>
<POSTER> Patrik </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> 2007-08-15T21:03:00 </POSTDATE>
I read George Monbiot's Heat last week (which makes this post very outdated indeed...). Its very good, everybody should read it. The thing is that it deals with how it is possible to, with a decent amount of probability, prevent that global warming goes into the beyond tolerable. It will be hard but doable.

The effect this book had on me is that I now feel ready to act. Monbiot basically shows what needs to be done, now we have to get about doing it. It won't be enough just to change one's own life, we have to start putting pressure on those in power.

Here is a good interview that will give you a good idea about what needs to be done (and why for those of you who do not know that). My favorite line is the one comparing what is required from us to face this crisis compared to WWII.

You say that flying less is a sacrifice too great for the people of this country to bear. But the last time the world was faced with an existential crisis - the rise of the Axis powers - millions of people were asked to sacrifice their lives to prevent it. Now, we are being asked to sacrifice our holidays in Florida and Thailand.

Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3 , Part 4 . (YouTube)

Now, there are some things about which I do not agree with Mr. Monbiot. They are not central to the argument. He essentially says that the controversy over what the scientific position on climate change is cause by people not understanding what science is. This I think is only part of the problem. Climate change reveals problems in the very scientific method itself. It clearly seems to be beyond what is possible for todays scientists to reach a scientific conclusion about the entire phenomenon. All the experts deal with small aspects in which the method works, but it seems that when it comes to compiling all this data it is no longer possible to keep the same methodical stringency. Hence the controversy over IPCC:s reports.

While there certainly does not exist any better tries as assessing the entire phenomenon then IPCC, it is still open to criticism, which sadly is used to prevent the needed the decisions to being taken.

I like Monbiot. He's a regular commentator in the Guardian over here. I don't always agree with him, but he's always earnest, well-researched and challenging on issues that the general populace seem to be more asleep on. A kind of prophet, no less.

It seems to me that anyone coming at the problem with an inherent prejudice (like most climate change critics do) will find a foothold on which to criticise.

Anyone who knows anything about science or the history of science will know that methodological consistency is not good enough grounds for criticism, otherwise we'd be questioning the very scientific principles of engineering that keep our roofs from collapsing on our heads.

Besides, there are more incentives other than climate change to get people to act on climate change.

There's simply no excuse to justify our wanton consumption of the earth's resources.

The other day I was listening to my CD of Mahler's Fifth Symphony through headphones. It must have been the first time I'd done so, because I was highly amused to discover that the conductor (the late Giuseppe Sinopoli) sings along with the orchestra in loud passages (though not, to my relief, during the Adagietto!)

The incident reminded me of another only-through-headphones gaffe, namely the unmistakeable sound of a pencil being knocked off a music stand during the second movemnent of the Tartini-Jacob Concertino on this recording .

And finally, a different kind of headphone anecdote. I once listened to this recording of the 1812 Overture (replete with real 19th century cannon, and terrific fun) through headphones, imagining (correctly) that it wouldn't be nearly as impressive as through decent speakers. However, from the reaction of other people in the room, I realised that the cannon fire sounded absolutely hilarous to those on the outside. Swapping places, I found it sounded like pop guns.

Does anyone else have interesting headphone anecdotes (especially things that only show up when you listen through phones)? Could be rustling, singing, anything really.

The third year at the Fringe from the Trachtenburgs , and the third time I've seen them. For those unfamiliar with them, the family are Jason, Tina and their daughter Rachel. What they do is to buy slide collections in car boot sales, junk shops, wherever, especially collections by anonymous deceased strangers. They then assemble the slides into some order corresponding to a surreal narrative which they then set to music. For example, an early number used a collection of slides most of which were pictures of eggs . It's an idea that works OK, though you wouldn't want to spend a long evening watching them. For an hour or even two, they're great fun. Tonight was the first night of the 2007 Edinburgh show, so there was a bit of bedding-in being done. There was also a very small audience (about ten of us) - the first time I've been to a gig of theirs that wasn't sold out. The material was good, though: we had Don't You Know What I Mean , Beautiful Dandelion , Look At Me , and a few whose names I've forgotten (one which was used in a maimed version by MTV which features a unitard-clad model posing alongside pictures of H-bomb explosions). Pride of place must surely go to the collection of slides which they picked up back in 2001, featuring a McDonalds Corporation internal management presentation (like Powerpoint without the computer). Snappily entitled Opnad Contribution Study Committee Report, June 1977, it encapsulates the whole Trachtenburg Family project.

Take a look at their website . Better still, go to see them. The humour comes from the surreal juxtapositions, and if that appeals to you you'll like them.

Arcade Fire, Glasgow SECC, 26 October 2007

I managed to miss the first support (Clinic) but caught most of the second (Wild Light), whio were pleasant indie fare, not unlike a less numerous and less orchestral Arcade Fire, in fact.

Arcade Fire themselves were wonderful, all ten of them. Their stage lighting is much more elaborate than I'd expected given their liking for small, intimate performances, but they are certainly geared up for the big venues now. They did quite a lot of stuff that wasn't familiar: one was introduced as an old song but others may have been new material. I went through the albums again and I don't think I was just being dumb: some of it really was different stuff. Some of the songs sound quite different live, though.

Numbers that I did recognise (and can remember!) were their opener ( Black Mirror ), Antichrist Television Blues , Tunnels , The Well and the Lighthouse , Power Out , Rebellion , Keep the Car Running , Intervention (first encore) and Wake Up (second encore, and with audience singing probably audible in Carlisle). They used quite a few video clips, including one of a crazed televangelist ranting which suddenly had me wondering if the band were about to morph into the Alabama 3 and do Mao Tse-Tung Said .

The vocals seemed rather muddy early on but seemed to be mixed further up later, though Regine's voice was still a bit thin. The instrumental mix was spot on, though, with Intervention sounding especially grand with its two violins, two French horns, pipe organ and glockenspiel (it sounded even better than on the album). I was a tiny bit disappointed that they didn't have a harp with them, as the harp parts on both albums are especially fine (and Wake Up in particular has a very prominent part). Still, mustn't grumble. The violinists (actually, one may have been a viola) appeared to be decorative as well as enthusiastic (I really should have taken binoculars, as the seated area in the SECC is some way from the stage). The pipe organ dominated the set though not (except on Intervention ) the mix. And I was trying to remember when I'd last seen a French horn on stage in a rock concert (Hilary reminded me: The Polyphonic Spree).

One thing I found sometimes amusing and sometimes just plain distracting was Will Butler's onstage antics. (Not to be confused with Wim Butler, who just gets on with singing and playing.) When called on to play glockenspiel, Will would be waving his beaters over his head as though trying to have the instrument accepted as a new event in the World Air Guitar championships. When playing cymbals he roamed around the stage clashing them in a life-threatening manner, up close and personal (though perfectly in time, of course). For his one number on guitar he ran repeatedly from side to side of the stage when playing, exactly like a stressed-out zoo animal in a small enclosure. And while playing glockenspiel during Wake Up he managed to knock over a suspended cymbal stand with one of his wild gestures. Not sure whether he was high or simply hyper-active: either way he was still getting the job done musically, but I did find myself wondering for each number what he'd be getting up to.

A good evening, though I can see why they prefer smaller venues with more audience rapport. A shame they didn't do their wonderful cover version of Serge Gainsbourg's Poupee de Cire, Poupee de Son as they did last time they played Glasgow: now that would have been perfect.

Hebrides Ensemble with Jane Irwin - Queens Hall 11 August 2007
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<POST>
<POSTER> sted by Rob @ </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> 2007-08-12T11:36:00 </POSTDATE>
So here we are, climbing the mountain of another year's Edinburgh Festival schedule. To begin at the beginning, or very nearly (this was, I think, the second show in the official festival) we rolled up at the Queens Hall to see mezzo-soprano Jane Irwin appearing with the Hebrides Ensemble. The concert began with Janáček's Mládi , a great piece for flute/oboe/clarinet/bass clarinet/bassoon/horn which doesn't get played all that often. Some fabulous horn playing from Steven Stirling (I had forgotten the extent to which the horn glues the whole thing together), solid bass clarinet from Matthew Hunt, and good performances from everyone else (though clarinettist Maximiliano Martin is one of those players who weaves around a lot which was a little distracting). Next we had an arrangement by Edward Harper for chamber ensemble [pno/2vlns/vla/vlc/fl(picc)/cl(bcl)/hn] of Mahler's song cycle Kindertotenlieder . Rather to our surprise they didn't use a conductor, which must have made life pretty difficult in places. Indeed, the beginning of the fourth song was a bit rocky for a few seconds; though they nailed the difficult start of the final In diesem Wetter . Jane Irwin was in good voice: some slightly iffy intonation at the very start settled down quickly and was probably just adrenaline. Edward Harper was clearly in the audience upstairs (out of our sight) as he got an acclamatory wave from the band at the end. Special praise to William Conway for his cello playing.

In the second half, we had a Nigel Osborne piece, not listed as a premiere but clearly fairly fresh (and the man himself came up to take a bow at the end so I'm guessing maybe the first big public airing). The piece was called Balkan Dances and Laments , scored for piano, violin, viola, cello and oboe, and arose from Osborne's interest in South Balkan music and especially in the relationship between its rhythmic structures and its harmonic ones. I'm not very familiar with Osborne's music, and while BD&amp;amp;L; didn't take me out of my comfort zone as a listener it took me well beynd it in terms of my ability to analyse what I was hearing in any coherent way. There were inevitably some sections which sounded like Bartók, sufficently so in a couple of places that I suspect deliberate homage rather than mere coincidence of musical roots. One interesting feature was that the pianist, as well as playing normally, is required at both the beginning and the end to play some of the piano strings with what looked like a loop of nylon tape (a violin bow without the stick, as it were) to create low hums. Overall quite an effective piece, and I may give it aother shot when BBC radio 3 broadcasts the concert (on August 28th, I think).

Finally Jane Irwin came back on for the piece I was most interested in, Luciano Berio's Folk Songs . Berio is one of those composers best known for his sometimes pretty extreme modernism, but in these songs written for his then wife Cathy Berberian he shows a charming and approachable side. Some of the songs are straightforward (-ish) arrangements of traditional songs from Armenia, Sicily, Sardinia and the Auvergne (the latter taken from Canteloube's famous collection). The two American songs are actually compositions by the late great John Jacob Niles (folk-song collector, singer and dulcimerist extraordinaire). The Italian songs in the suite are pure Berio in their music (though I think traditional in lyrics). Finally, there is a glorious Azerbaijan Love Song which was found by Cathy Berberian on an old Soviet 78 rpm record. She transcribed the text (in an Azerbaijani dialect) phonetically; apart from one passage - sung in Russin for some reason - in which love is compared to a stove, the lyrics have to date defied translation.

Jane Irwin did a magnificent job on the Berio songs. Berberian had a uniquely flexible voice and a prodigious talent, and any singer tackling a piece written for her is liable to find it a tall order. In the songs where a robust approach is called for (the programme notes describe Berberian &amp;quot;bawling with the subtlety of a fishmonger&amp;quot; in her recording of A la femminisca ) the strain of simply not being Cathy perhaps showed a little, but Ms Irwin clearly wasn't going to be overcome by it. In the more delicately written songs her voice was very beautiful, and all the performances were perfectly judged (and beautifully supported by the ensemble, now comprising flute, clarinet, viola, cello, harp and two percussionists). (A propos the latter, one doesn't often see two sets of tubular bells being played at the same time!) For the final Azerbaijan Love Song everyone, but most especially Jane Irwin, simply let rip with the sheer joy of music-making. Tremendous. Listen for yourselves when the BBC broadcast it.

I loved this post of Anna's. It reminded me of my favourite bits in Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery , the ones where he's just killed an evil henchman and we cut to a scene with the henchman's grieving family or friends:

94 INT. KITCHEN

A pleasant-looking MIDDLE AGED LADY answers the phone.

MIDDLE AGED LADY
Hello?
(pause)
Yes, this is Mrs. Harwin.
(pause)
Yes, I have a son named Steve Harwin.
(pause)
Yes, that's right, he's a henchman in Dr. Evil's Private Army.
(pause)
What? Killed?
(pause)
How?
(pause)
Run over by a steamroller? Oh my God. Thank you for calling.

She HANGS UP. A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD enters.

FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD
Hi Mom! When's Steve coming home? He said he was going to teach me to play ball.

MRS. HARWIN
Sit down, Billy, I have some bad news. As you know, your brother Steven was a henchman in Dr. Evil's Private Army.

BILLY
Was? What is it, Mom?

MRS. HARWIN
Your brother was run over by a steamroller.

BILLY
A steamroller?
(bursting into tears)
No, not Steve! Since Dad died, Steve's been like a father to me.

MRS. HARWIN
I'm sorry son. People never think how things affect the family of the henchman.
(hugging him)
I love you, Billy.
(to herself, out loud)
I wonder if we'll be able to receive Steve's henchman's comp.

and

105 EXT. HOOTERS RESTAURANT - DAY

It is a sports bar-type restaurant that has scantily clad BUSTY WAITRESSES.

106 INT. HOOTERS RESTAURANT

At a table we see fifteen or so TWENTY-SOMETHING GUYS, scouting chicks, drinking ugs of beer.

GUY 1
I can't believe John Smith is getting married tomorrow.

GUY 2
Where is Smittie anyways? It's not like him to be late for anything, especially his own stag party.

GUY 3
Well, you know he's a henchman for Dr. Evil. Sometimes they work late. Can I just say something that may sound a little sappy? I think it's a testament to our friend John that so many of his buddies showed up in his honor. There's a lot of love in this room.

A large-breasted WAITRESS approaches with a phone.

WAITRESS
Hi, I have a phone call here for the John Smith party.

GUY 1
Hello?
(pause)
Yes, I have a friend named John Smith.
(pause)
That's right, he's in Dr. Evil's private army.
(pause)
What? He's dead?
(pause)
Decapitated by mutated flying sea bass? Oh my God! OK, thank you.

He hangs up.

GUY 2
(to Guy 1)
Hey Bill, what's wrong? Was that John? Is he coming late?

GUY 1
Guys, John's not coming.

GUY 2
Why?

GUY 1
He was decapitated by mutated flying sea bass.

GUYS
(upset)
Oh no, oh my God, etc.

GUY 1
All right, to Smittie!

Everyone raises their glasses.

To Smittie!

Schrodinger's Gondola

Went to see the Edinburgh Gilbert & Sullivan Society's production of The Gondoliers on Thursday. I knew most of the orchestra (my wife among them) and at least one of the chorus. The principals were mostly the usual suspects: Ian Lawson as the Duke of Plaza Tora, Barbara Brodie as the Duchess, Sandy Horsburgh as Don Alhambra, Neil French as Luiz and Fiona Main as Gianetta were all very good. However, I was most impressed by the new kid on the block, Amanda Stewart as Casilda. Her voice is quite light but her diction and acting are both excellent, and I look forward to seeing her in further principal roles.

The Gondoliers is best known these days for a few musical numbers: "Take A Pair of Sparkling Eyes"and "Dance a Cachucha", along with a few lines from Don Alhambra's songs "Of that there is no shadow of doubt/ No probable possible manner of doubt/ No possible doubt whatever" and "When everybody's somebody, then no-one's anybody". But as I watched the plot unfold, with its pair of gondoliers, one of whom is heir to a crown and betrothed from childhood to a Spanish noblewoman - the problem being that nobody is quite sure which one it is- I thought how very far ahead of his time Gilbert was. As well as all the fun he has with the two gondoliers running a court on highly egalitarian lines, he also makes considerable play of the fact that they share the crown and the betrothal for now because nobody knows which is the rightful heir, but when the knowledgeable nursemaid turns up all will become clear: one will be a king, the other a commoner, one the husband of Casilda, the other free to marry his own choice. And I thought of Schrodinger's cat, half alive and half dead until someone looks to see how it is, when it becomes either dead or alive. Marco and Giuseppe are in a quantum superposition of states, in which they remain until the nursemaid arrives to collapse their wave-function and resolve everything nicely. And Gilbert managed this before quantum mechanics had been invented. Imagine the fun he would have had with relativity and quantum physics to work into his plots.

Details here .

More actions here .

If the history of the former Soviet Union shows us anything it's that protests aren't always in vain: though if China would give less support to the Burmese economy that might speed things up. As it is, any UN resolution that, say, the US proposes to impose sanctions may well get vetoed by CHina. While it might be good for the American delegation to understand how the rest of the world feels when it routinely vetoes any censure motions against Israel, the people who suffer will be the Burmese. And they've suffered enough .

Richard O'Brien's &quot;Mephistopheles Smith&quot; - Augustines, 11 August 2007
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<POST>
<POSTER> sted by Rob @ </POSTER>

Back in 1995 I went to a Fringe show called Disgracefully Yours , written by and starring Richard O'Brien (creator of The Rocky Horror Show , presenter of The Crystal Maze , etc etc). Its basic premise was that these days consumer choice is all-important, so it had been decided that instead of people being allocated to heaven or hell in the afterlife they should be given the chance to choose. The show was hell's advertising pitch in the afterlife facilities market; an attempt to capitalise on heaven's image problem and increase market share. O'Brien played Mephistopheles Smith. The show subsequently transferred to London , ran for a while, then vanished.

Until now, when as Richard O'Brien's &amp;quot;Mephistopheles Smith&amp;quot; it has returned to Edinburgh with Janus Theatre Company . There have been some changes to the musical numbers, and many to the dialogue (actually mostly monologue), but it's still recognisably the same show. Now the lead role is played by Paul Roberts (ex-Stranglers) and the Frockettes have become the Devilettes (Francesca Casey and Roxanne Palmer, both highly eloquent sales reps for the sins of the flesh). The show started out with a couple of technical glitches (a light wasn't working, and Roxanne's radio mike dropped out occasionally) but it all rapidly came together. The strength of the material has a lot to do with it, of course: the opening number (Must Be Mephistopheles Smith) is one of ROB's good ones (&amp;quot;Who owns the soul of the rock'n' roll riff? Why it's very very possibly Mephistopheles Smith.&amp;quot;) But - it may seem sacrilegious to say this - I think Paul Roberts was a better Smith than ROB himself. Oh, ROB was very funny, and very sardonic, and very creepy as only ROB can be. But as far as actually selling the whole hell experience goes, Roberts was much more convincing. I mean, Richard O'Brien is always going to be just a little bit edgy, creepy, weird..... and maybe if you're trying to pick out your niche for eternity that isn't what you want. But Paul Roberts? All things to all men (and women), and could sell snow to eskimos, even without his little helpers. (I have to say this: the Devilettes looked marvellous, tight Lycra displaying asses to die for - but the bulging radio mike units in the back of their waistbands definitely distracted attention from their USPs....) And he can sing, of course, at least as well as ROB if not better.

The finale is Anyhow, Anyhow , which is a retread from Shock Treatment (though as that musical was shamefully neglected it does no harm to air one of its strongest numbers). I can't remember whether ROB used it in the original show, but I suspect not; however, it fits perfectly, and the cast perform it with great verve.

I really do recommend anyone who likes musicals at all to go and see this one. It isn't Rocky Horror ; it isn't even Shock Treatment ; but it is very funny and has some great songs. There is a CD on sale for £5, which has six songs from the show on it (though with a different cast from earlier in the tour). Worth it IMO. You can get more songs (performed by ROB himself) on Absolute O'Brien if you like. The show is at the Fringe until 26 August; then goes to Reading (31/8 - 1/9) and Guildford (3/10-6/10). See it: it could be another 12 years before you get the chance again.

Ben Arthur (The Cobbler) 26 August 2007

Hilary and I accompanied Vanessa over to Loch Long on Sunday to do the final stage of her birthday present, which was a dry suit diving course (essential if she wants to do any diving in chilly Scottish waters). Ruairidh had a rehearsal with his band, so stayed behind.

Once we'd dropped her off and left her amid a pile of air tanks, Hilary and I headed for Arrochar, whence we climbed The Cobbler (aka Ben Arthur). We'd already ticked off all the &amp;quot;Arrochar Alps&amp;quot; Munros in the area, but although we'd tried to do The Cobbler when we lived in Stirling, we'd never had the weather. Well, on Sunday we had the weather, we made the climb, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The Cobbler is just a great mountain. Never mind that it's only a Corbett (though a fairly tall one). It's not only a spectacular hill to look at (because of its skyline - see picture above), it's a great one to look from . Probably the best view of Ben Lomond to be had anywhere, and plenty of more distant things, along with a birds-eye view of Loch Long. Oh yes, birds: several ravens croaked a welcome for us. (And while we were having a pre-climb bacon roll in Arrochar, we'd noticed that the birds flying just outside, over the loch, were gannets: much the closest to shore I've ever seen them.)

There was a very large (40-odd) party climbing The Cobbler on Sunday, who turned out to be with a chap celebrating his 75th birthday. He'd been up around a hundred times, he thought, and it was his dog's thirteenth ascent. Much champagne was being consumed at the top, or more pedantically on the summit ridge which links the three summits.

I couldn't be bothered doing the North top (too hot, and The Cobbler is a very steep climb, being 880-odd meters and climbed from sea level in about three horizontal miles), though Hilary did. (That's the one on the right in the top picture above.) The South Top is a difficult scramble and nobody seems to bother much with it except rock climbers. The central, and highest, top is however great fun, not just a scramble but a sort of hilltop adventure playground. To get to the top, you have to clamber across a gap into a hole in the rock (The Window), which you crawl through and out the other side. There you find a ledge which you climb along, before reaching a point where you have to turn round and start doing proper climbing - searching for holds, bridging across a gap - for a couple of moves. Then up a slab to the top. Then reverse the whole lot back down again. Hugely enjoyable.

Down to the loch to meet Vanessa at the Village Inn in Arrochar, where she and the rest of the divers were doing their log books. A nice (if very busy) pub with a decent selection of beers. What more could we want? (Well, apart from slightly less traffic on the way back to Glasgow.)

I've posted a few of Hilary's pictures. Below are a couple from http://www.sub3000.com/ which nicely show the main summit: first someone crawling though the &amp;quot;window&amp;quot;, then someone who has just come out of it and is moving along the ledge.

Rep Theatre Company: Dirty Linen / New Found Land (St Columba's By The Castle, 27 August 2007)
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<POST>
<POSTER> sted by Rob @ </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> 2007-08-29T17:21:00 </POSTDATE>
I hadn't seen Tom Stoppard's Dirty Linen since I saw it on its original West End run at the Arts Theatre (with Edward de Souza, Peter Bowles, and with Luan Peters as Maddie, the young lady who ends up stripped to her underwear by the middle of the play). I can't say who Maddie or anyone else was in this Fringe production, though, as there was no cast list available. Ah well. (I gather from Googling that Rep Theatre Company come from Repton School and are aged between 18 and 21. Presumably former pupils, then. they brought The Real Inspector Hound to the Fringe a coupel of years back, which may be the one I saw and enjoyed.)

Like most early Stoppard, Dirty Linen is crammed with wordplay, most of which they allowed to breathe. It also has the comic business where Maddie serially loses items of clothing, which they managed very well. (I know, I was watching carefully.......) The story is all about a Parliamentary Select Committee investigating tabloid allegations of sexual shenanigans among MPs, all of whom appear to have been bedding Maddie (whose proper name is Miss Gotobed). Most of the journalists seem to have been bonking her as well; her work rate must be astounding.

I suppose the problem is that Stoppard put a break in the main action (allowing Maddie to get dressed again) which he then filled with the rather odd play-within-a-play which is New Found Land . As originally written it comprised two monologues, one by a boring old fart about a bet he made with an American, and one a manic travelogue by an enthusiastic youngster. I can't really imagine anyone making the first part very interesting (Stephen Moore - best known now as Marvin the Paranoid Android - had a struggle to do so in the original run), and the Rep Company were probably quite clever simply to drop it altogether. They had a woman rather than a man reminiscing about the crazy train journey on first arriving in the USA (New York - New England - Chicago - New Orleans - Texas - Oklahoma - Rockies - Los Angeles, all in one train ride!) It's a speech that relies on pacing for its effect, rather like Lucky's speech in Waiting For Godot, and with similar mania behind it. Our anonymous woman on Monday did pretty well with a really very difficult speech.

Not too much to say about individual performances without names (or character names for a crib). Generally solid playing, especially from French (who ends up drawing up the committees's report along with Maddie). And Maddie was wearing bright red frilly knickers. Did I mention that?

Edinburgh Film Festival Thursday 26 June - Man On Wire

The European premiere, this, of a documentary about Philippe Petit : specifically about his high wire walk between the two towers of the World Trade Center in New York on 7 August 1974. It's coming out on general release soon, and all I'll say is WOW. I was totally gripped by the story. Funded by the BBC as part of their Storyville documentary strand, it's a mixture of archive footage and dramatised re-enactment, but very well blended together.

The screening was attended by both the director (James Marsh) and by Petit himself, who took part in a Q & A session afterwards. From this I doscovered that two of the reels had been shown in the wrong order, so what I'd taken to be an odd kind of flashback was simlay a cock-up. But the film still worked, which says something. Oh, and Sean Connery was in the audience, and rated it one of the three best films he'd ever seen (nope, wouldn't say what the others were).

Seriously, you have got to see this. Here are some pictures for you to be going on with:

I just got Petit's book out of the library, which also looks really good.

The fleet set sail for Rockall,
Rockall,

To free the isle of Rockall,
From fear of foreign foe.
We sped across the planet,
To find this lump of granite,
One rather startled Gannet;
In fact, we found.......Rockall.

So, praise the brave Bell-bottoms,
Bottoms,
Bottoms,
Who saw Britannia's Peril,
And answered to her call,
Though we're thrown out of Malta,
Though Spain should take Gibraltar,
Why should we flinch or falter,
When England's got......Rockall.

A kind of meme, cribbed from an interview Douglas Adams gave which is reprinted in The Salmon Of Doubt . As I cribbed it from memory I've probably forgotten a few of the original questions, and have definitely added one or two of my own.

Ooh, I had to google Aishwarya Rai. She's lovely. Good choice.

The rest are all good choices too. I was surprised at Rickman because he's very unlike Ares as I describe him in the book, but his innate sulkiness would be excellent for it. Kidman I hadn't thought of but she can definitely do icy and sexless for Artemis. Branagh as Apollo is particularly inspired, as are Mirren / Jacobi. And Kris Marshall! Such a good call! He's a bit tall for Neil but we'll let that fly.

All in all I am dead chuffed. We'll see if the Stiller boy can do as well as you...

Now this is what I call an interesting site: a mix of the mainstream amd the seriously flaky. Where else could you investigate the Smithsonian's collections (the best of which - including their Apollo 11 module - came to an Edinburgh Festival about 20 years ago) and an analysis of every car in the Tintin cartoons? Not to mention Nebraskan payphones. (Thanks to last Saturday's Guardian for the link.)

I enjoyed this article in the Guardian recently. Personally I thought it was way cool when I first discovered that German had a special letter for double S. Nobody had warned me about it (I hadn't done German in school) but all of a sudden, there it was, on signs and in newspapers. It didn't take rocket science to work out what it was replacing (I think Straße on street names was the giveaway) but it gave me (aged twelve, first time in continental Europe) a great feeling that this was somewhere foreign. More so than the cops with guns, or the driving on the right. So YAY for the Eszett.

I followed it up via Wikipedia , and thence to here . And before I knew it I was in one of those silly how-the-hell-did-I-get-here link-hopping sessions, following links to other weird letters like yogh (where I found out why Scots pronounce Menzies as "Mingies", Finzean as "Fingan" and Dalziel as "Di-ell"). Then onwards, via futhorc to thorn .

Thorn reminded me of the episode in Anthony Burgess's autobiography (strongly recommended) - probably in Little Wilson and Big God , though possibly in You've Had Your Time - where Burgess and a drunken student pal are careering round the medieval centre of Manchester, specifically the Shambles area (long before it was relocated, when it was still where I remember it). The drunken friend looks at an inn sign (presumably the Wellington ) and starts shouting enthusiastically "That's a proper thorn there, man.... they've got a fucking actual thorn there..."., with a not-totally-sober-himself Burgess trying to hush him up before they attract undue attention from passers-by for being loudly drunk in the middle of the afternoon.

Anyway, hop, hop, hop, on to Thorn and Eth before alighting at this splendid article. And I'm sorry, I looked at its title line and I started giggling.

Hence my post title.

Sorry.

Do you ever have days like that ?

On the other hand, the same issue of the Guardian as Jenkins' piece contained this . One of those rare pieces of journalism in which I really think I can find nothing with which I disagree (and many facts less well-appreciated than they should be, such as the absence of fundamentalist terrorists in Iraq under Saddam).

Coincidentally, my American (but Edinburgh-based) friend Chip posted in a similar vein recently.

This struck me as funny.

OK, maybe I'm weird. I learned the basics of LISP (if one is allowed to use the word BASIC in the same sentence as LISP) from a housemate during my abortive teacher training year (not really abortive: it trained me that teaching and I were mutually unsuited) who played Kwai-Gon Jin to my Obi-Wan Kenobi, instructing me in the ways of LISP and ALGOL before I took my training and prostituted it in the land of COBOL (viz. London). While I wouldn't say that my &amp;quot;Jedi training&amp;quot; was the most important influence on my programming style (that would be my exposure to the work of Michael Jackson )(no, not that Michael Jackson) it had the lasting effect of making me aware that style is not just an optional extra but something integral to the success of a program. Even after all the lessons of real life, not to mention all the refinements of my priorities that go with the shift from amateur to professional, that's still valid.

Oh, I think the word &amp;quot;dabbled&amp;quot; is more aporopriate than &amp;quot;programmed&amp;quot;, in my case at least (my housemate wrote something substantial for his degree - I have a feeling it was in fact a LISP interpreter). I can't remember whether I went beyond paper exercises and actually ran anything or not. I may have done, but nothing much.

But yes, like Algol 68 (which I admired from a distance) LISP has a nostalgia-filtered image probably out of proportion to its actual significance.

For many years I have been a fan of the music of Steve Reich, and especially fascinated by some of his early experiments with tape loops such as Come Out . In this piece, we hear a fragment of speech played on two tape loops (later on four and eight) gradually drifting out of sync with each other. At first the effect is of a slight echo, but as the separation increases the actual speech rapidly becomes hard to distinguish, and what we are left with is patterns of high- medium- and low-frequency sounds. The high frequencies in particular comnine in strange ways to form bizarre sussurations. So Reich is pulling the sound apart horizontally, along its time axis, and thus drawing attention to its vertical (frequency) components.

Alvin Lucier, on the other hand, hit on a clever alternative: a sort of inversion of Reich's procedure. For his piece I Am Sitting In A Room , he recorded a fragment of speech, then played it back in a room, re-recorded it, played it back again and so on. This procedure amplifies the resonant frequencies of the room so that at first you hear the speech gradually becoming 'vertically' distorted, though the rhythmic aspects remain intact. Eventually the frequency distortion is so intense that the original speech rhythms become impossible to distinguish, and even spotting when the next iteration is beginning becomes hard.

Here is a link ( via ) to a site where you can download his recording. It's really quite extraordinary. And when you hear the recording you realise why in the text he describes the procedure as smoothing out irregularities in his speech: he has a stammer.

For me... there is always a fascinating element to these sorts of experiments. I very much like Steve Reich - and feel perhaps it these experiments that led to some of his more interesting pieces (Hand Clapping).

However - as interesting as they are I don't necessarily make the leap from what they're doing to how it can be used in a musical sense. My head just doesn't seem to work that say...

Like Xenakis, there are extremely interesting elements to them and their exploration of the sound world...

Despite all the hassle, I couldn't miss the opportunity to post something tonight. Not to moan that Jamie Murray and Liezel Huber were beaten in the mixed doubles semi-final at Wimbledon. Not even to cheer that the unseeded Laura Robson is through to the girls' final, though cheer I shall (YAY!).

No, today is Eine Kleine Nichtmusik 's third birthday! How time flies! A big thank-you to all the regular and irregular visitors who make blogging feel a bit less of an onanistic endeavour, and whose comments add a bit of variety: necessary even for this "wildly eclectic" (thank you, Persephone) blog.

While I'm online, though, the weather this week has been great in spite of the dire forecast. We've had plenty of good walking, been over to Handa, seen thousands of seabirds, a number of seals, some interesting ruins, and so many and such varied wild flowers that even your humble blogger, generally immune to botanical charms especially if there are birds about, was impressed. No whales or dolphins though. Bah!

I thought this story was wonderful.

Here's another view of the toilet-shaped house, showing the, er, business end.

Surely confusion may arise between the Korea-based World Toilet Association and its elder sibling from Singapore, the World Toilet Organisation. Perhaps they need handy little symbols to put on their doors to avoid embarrassment........

However, my first - and abiding - thought on reading the story of Korea's &amp;quot;Mayor Toilet&amp;quot; was that someone with his name and obsession in Britain would undoubtedly be dubbed &amp;quot;Toilet Duck&amp;quot; .

OK, this has gone far enough. Wannabe novelist Martin Amis (has anyone not paid to do so actually finished any of his books? Even the Booker-shortlisted and heavily derivative Time's Arrow had me ready to gnaw off a limb to escape after two chapters) first of all spouts racist drivel, then when he's called on it, instead of apologising, he blusters and lies. Consider his original interview with Ginny Dougary in the Guardian:

“What can we do to raise the price of them doing this? There’s a definite urge – don’t you have it? – to say, ‘The Muslim community will have to suffer until it gets its house in order.’ What sort of suff­­er­­­ing? Not letting them travel. Deportation – further down the road. Curtailing of freedoms. Strip-searching people who look like they’re from the Middle East or from Pakistan… Discriminatory stuff, until it hurts the whole community and they start getting tough with their children. They hate us for letting our children have sex and take drugs – well, they’ve got to stop their children killing people. It’s a huge dereliction on their part. &amp;quot;

The main responses are linked here .

Apologists for Amis like Christopher Hitchens have claimed that he wasn't expressing a view but conducting a thought experiment. But he didn't say &amp;quot;What would happen if...?&amp;quot;, he said &amp;quot;There's a definite urge - don't you have it? - to say....&amp;quot;. The nudge-nudge of &amp;quot;Don't you have it?&amp;quot; makes it abundantly clear where Amis's sympathies lie on the matter. I assume he would not have said in the aftermath of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon &amp;quot;There's a definite urge - don't you have it? - to firebomb synagogues and assault Jews in the street&amp;quot;. Doubtless some people had such an urge, as they doubtless do with the one in Amis's interview. But one may, I think, be certain that Amis would have been careful to distance himself from any suggestion of sympathy with the former. Yet given ample opportunity for such distancing in the present case, what does he come up with?

Well, let's look in Saturday's Guardian . Apparently:

&amp;quot;I DO NOT &amp;quot;ADVOCATE&amp;quot; ANY DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT OF MUSLIMS. AND I NEVER HAVE. And no one with the slightest respect for truth can claim otherwise.&amp;quot;

Well, in the same way as Judith Weiss of Kesher Talk didn't &amp;quot;advocate&amp;quot; the nuclear destruction of Iran via a false-flag sneak attack. She simply reported someone else's advocacy thereof and described it as one of those &amp;quot;Things that make you go &amp;quot;Hmmm&amp;quot;. Actually, Amis's hypocrisy is worse than Weiss's, because Amis can't even point to someone else and claim to be reporting their views. The &amp;quot;urge&amp;quot; he describes (do I feel it? no) is all his own work.

So OK, Martin: you are content to stand by while others more honest than you about their views do the dirty work of discriminating against Muslims. And no one with the slightest familiarity with the English language can claim otherwise.

&amp;quot;The Muslim community will have to suffer.........Discriminatory stuff, until it hurts the whole community&amp;quot;.

(In fact, even he doesn't claim they aren't his views. Later in the piece he says:

The comments I made, in addition, were prefaced by the following: &amp;quot;There's a definite urge to say...&amp;quot; When Bennett wonders why I don't &amp;quot;recant&amp;quot;, what does he expect me to do? Pretend that I didn't in fact experience this transient impulse (which was not racist but simply retaliatory)? Does he want - do you want - novelists to sound like politicians, or like the pious post-historical automata that Bennett and Eagleton claim to be? Do you want the voice of the individual, or the aggressive purity of the ideologue?

So he admits to feeling the emotions he previously denied having, but says it's OK because it was only a &amp;quot;transient&amp;quot; &amp;quot;retaliatory&amp;quot; impulse, and justifies it as the &amp;quot;voice of the individual&amp;quot;. What a pompous, self-regarding twat.)

Amis goes on, spewing out risible drive-by comparisons of the Guardian issue in which he was first taken to task to Julius Streicher's Der Stürmer , and claiming that he isn't concerned with race at all but with ideology. Ah, right: so strip-searching &amp;quot;people who look like they're from the Middle East or Pakistan&amp;quot; isn't racist? Because, as anyone who has been watching the news this week from Khartoum will know, all Muslim extremists look like that, and the black chappies we've been watching on TV are all above suspicion. Plus, one would never find, on a casual search of, say, Glasgow or Bradford, any British people who &amp;quot;look like they're from Pakistan&amp;quot;, would one? No, this isn't about labelling as a suspected terrorist everyone of Arab or South Asian ethnicity (many of whom will be Christian, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist or who knows what else), but about ideology. Right. So the guy who runs my local Nepalese restaurant is clearly more ideologically unsound than a bloke in Khartoum with a bloody great sword demanding death for Gillian Gibbons. Or than Timothy McVeigh, or Theodore Kaczynski the Unabomber. He justs look ideologically, er, brown, rather than black or white. (Oh, or yellow: remember Aum Shinrikyo?)

Actually, maybe Amis doesn't realise that Britain is full of brown people. After all, he takes several paragraphs to tell us that he'd never seen a black person until he was five or six; perhaps he has yet to see a British Asian. Yet it's Ronan Bennett who &amp;quot;thinks like an idiot&amp;quot; for suggesting that he is &amp;quot;hostile to Islam on racial grounds - a self-evident absurdity&amp;quot;. Well, OK, yes, I think we've now worked out that it's the other way round: that Amis is hostile to brown people on Islamophobic grounds. Glad to have cleared that up. Silly Ronan Bennett.

Finally, lacking the guts either to own up to his racist and Islamophobic attitudes (which become more evident every time the fool opens his mouth or sits at a keyboard) or to distance himself from his odious remarks, Amis does what far-right ideologues (oh, what, so now it's not about ideology?) always do: he misrepresents, he lies, and finally stoops to abuse. Ronan Bennett, according to Amis, &amp;quot;appease(s) jihadism&amp;quot;, which is

irrationalist, misogynist, homophobic, inquisitional, totalitarian and imperialist. And it isn't merely &amp;quot;racist&amp;quot;. It is genocidal.

I think I like the scare quotes round &amp;quot;racist&amp;quot; best. A fine piece of wriggling by a lethally-punctured ultra-rightist windbag. Who isn't merely racist, but a racist, xenophobic, self-deluding, hypocritical liar.

Let me finish with the only belly-laugh in Amis's article. As befits someone whose celebrity is largely derived from that of his infinitely more talented father, Amis can't resist dropping names. Here he's dropping that of a fellow xenophobic, self-deluding, hypocritical liar:

When I interviewed Tony Blair earlier this year I asked him if continental demographics had yet become &amp;quot;a European conversation&amp;quot;. He said: &amp;quot;It's a subterranean conversation.&amp;quot; And we know what that means.

Well actually, Mr Amis, we don't. It doesn't make sense; it isn't even English. It's as flaccid and devoid of meaning as most Amis (or Blair) pronouncements, and a prime candidate for Pseuds' Corner.

Now piss off and don't go wasting any more of the Guardian's newsprint until you've acquired a little knowledge of the world you live in and of the civilised values you pretend to care for.

The thing that really gives the game away is who he thinks it's appropriate to retaliate against; not Islamists, who at times he seems capable of distinguishing from Muslims in general, but anyone who is stereotypically Muslim-looking. Wanting to collectively punish people not on grounds of actual complicity in the crimes committed but on simple grounds of ethnicity: that has to be racism.

And he's here .

One of his posts altered me to this strange story. I agree with him that as the bloke was in his room, in private, it's hard to see what the fuss was about, let alone why he should be put on the Sex Offenders Register and have the rest of his life ruined.

Not all doom and gloom, though, dear me no. This post contains the full text of his Rectorial Address to the students at Dundee University, which is hilarious (while probably making the university authorities squirm uncomfortably at the description oif their democratic deficit). It's worth reading the full thing, though here's a brief sample:

Becoming Rector here fulfils two of my great ambitions in life. The first was when I had a Highland Reel named after me, written by in my view Scotland’s best traditional music exponents the Battlefield Band. Sadly the great Jimmy Shand is no longer with us, but I like to imagine it at ceilidhs – “Our next set is a highland reel, with The Lang Heid followed by Lady Margaret Campbell of Glenlyon followed by Ambassador Craig Murray of Tashkent.” That will confuse them.

So my very own reel a great honour, and my first ambition. My second was to become Rector of the University of Dundee.

I might have to give up on the third, as I don’t suppose Kylie Minogue would be up for it.

Back home after a great week in Ballater. The weather stayed good so we got plenty of walking and cycling done as well as the obligatory pottering, scone-eating and shopping. Got a good view of some ravens on Meikle Pap, heard dozens of stags bellowing (both very close and loud, and distant, echoing and atmospheric) and kept our distance from the people (evidenced mostly by their Land Rovers and ponies) taking advantage of the last few days of the deer stalking season. Oh, and we watched Dil Se and most of I, Claudius on DVD.

Now I'm catching up on radio programmes I missed. The BBC, bless them, are serialising Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency by Douglas Adams, and while it's not the Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy it is a very good book. It's therefore with some relief that I can report that they're doing a good job, with Harry Enfield surprisingly good as DG, and Billy Boyd as Richard Macduff demonstrating that his appalling acting in LOTR was just an aberration. The cast also includes Robert Duncan (Gus from Drop The Dead Donkey , one of my all-time favourite TV comedies) and Andrew Sachs (Manuel from Fawlty Towers ).

I've also begun to catch up with Old Harry's Game , most of whose first episode I caught one night on the car radio. And I'm looking forward to listening to this week's Friday Play , which I might have overlooked had it not been for Lisa .

I wondered at first if I'd be missing out by only having heard the album once, about 10 years ago.

And while on the topic of Eurovision, one of the links along the way to Ms Gall was to this cracking performance by Sarek , taking part in the selection for Sweden's Eurovision 2003 entry. It may not have been picked, but IMO it knocks spots off most years' winners. I mean, how can you resist two miniskirted women (who can sing), and a hurdy-gurdy, and a nyckelharpa? Jings.....

Here's another video you might enjoy. No miniskirts, just a nyckelharpist playing Bach .

Hah! you think that's cool? I just bought a CD of Marco Ambrosini and Didier Francois playing Bartok's 44 Duos for Two Violins, on nyckelharpas of course.

Probably that's about as sad as reading Wikipedia articles on Magnesium Diboride. Time I went to bed. Though I may have another burst of Genom Eld och Vatten before I go....

The first of a series of posts featuring video clips of artists I'm especially fond of. Here we go with Richard Thompson, probably the greatest electric guitarist still alive (Zappa being dead).

Let's begin with Richard doing Cooksferry Queen .

Then with his (then) wife Linda, doing Lonely Hearts . You may well not know this one: it's from Sunnyvista , their most neglected album.

Next up is Richard doing a song by John French (sometime drummer for Captain Beefheart) and John's wife Donna Blair: Now That I Am Dead . (Fom this album.)

Richard's most requested song is, I believe, still Beeswing . Listen and you'll understand why: there are few better narrative lyrics.

On the six albums that Richard &amp;amp; Linda made together, they recorded precisely two songs penned by Linda (though she wasn't given a writing credit either time). One was &amp;quot;Did She Jump Or Was She Pushed&amp;quot;; the other was Pavanne . Here is a clip of them doing both Pavanne and It's The Motion on the Jake Thakray Show. I remember watching this broadcast, absolutely spellbound. The songs remain two of my favourites.

Richard in upbeat mood here, doing his &amp;quot;cynic's love song&amp;quot; Nearly In Love . How can you resist a song with the line &amp;quot;I'm almost aware of walking on air&amp;quot;?

And to finish, my all-time favourite, A Heart Needs A Home . I could never tire of this song.

I've just emailed the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation what I hope is a pretty self-explanatory email.

KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK

For some time now I have been being spammed by a bunch of Zionist apologists, presumably because I frequently blog about Israeli human rights violations. These saddos, who call themselves Honest Reporting Canada (how Orwellian is that?) are currently asking their &amp;quot;subscribers&amp;quot; (strangely the &amp;quot;unsubscribe&amp;quot; function doesn't work) to bombard CBC with
complaints that you don't call enough people terrorists.

&amp;quot;Since our inception, we have called on the Canadian media to describe individuals whose intentional use of violence against civilians, done in order to achieve religious, political or ideological objectives, as terrorists. Instead, these individuals and their actions are labeled in the broadest political terms as militants, insurgents, activists, guerillas, and politicians.&amp;quot;

I am pleased to see that CBC upholds the same high standards of journalistic and production ethics as the BBC World Service in this regard, and are resisting the temptation to describe as terrorists those Israeli &amp;quot;politicians&amp;quot; &amp;quot;soldiers&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;settlers&amp;quot; who have left such an egregious trail of slaughter, torture and theft through the Middle East over the past sixty years.

Regards

As requested, I copied my email with a covering note to &amp;quot;Honest Reporting Canada&amp;quot;. I hope they liked it, spamming bastards.

I've just read this , which is pretty interesting.

I gather that in a recent CNN interview America's Disgrace claimed it was justifiable to have put his emergency response centre in WTC 7 because the Secret Service and the CIA had their offices there. Page 5 of the Village Voice piece explains that the decision to locate those offices was made by Bill Diamond when he worked for Reagan. The decision to put New York's disaster centre there was made by the same guy when he worked for Rudy. The fact that the building was owned by a major Giuliani fund-raiser probably simplified the decision-making on these occasions.

I loved the description of NYC's clownish response to a purported sarin gas risk, with nobody using protective gear and half of City Hall standing around on the front lawn. (Also Rudy worrying about the risk if the gas &amp;quot;ignited&amp;quot; - yup, America's Genius on the ball there as ever.)

While watching the banjo video clip from a few posts back , I noticed this one in the sidebar. Yes, that's right: the besuited youth with the banjo and guitar would in only five years be Eight Miles High, and the following year would be cynically reflecting:

So you want to be a rock 'n' roll star? then listen now to what I say
Just get an electric guitar and take some time and learn how to play
And if your hair's combed right and your pants are tight it's gonna be all right

Then it's time to go downtown where the agent man won't let you down
Sell your soul to the company who are waiting there to sell plastic ware
And in a week or two if you make the charts the girls'll tear you apart

Nobody, though, was tearing apart the Chad Mitchell Trio.

The times were, indeed, a-changing.

P.S. This video from the same site puts me in mind of the line from one of the Star Trek films where someone quotes Shakespeare and another character says he like the line even better in the original Klingon. Well, here is Bach on the original banjo. What?

Udge: indeed it would.From the fact that I had to look carfully to convince myself that some of the scramblings were genuine anagrams, I suspect a single-letter error would sail through unless it mapped to another real word. Of course, transposition errors which are the commonest typos would have no effect!

Joe: you missed one of the essential points which is that you need to keep the proper first and last letters (which is why only four-letter and longer words get sabcelmrd). And EGGS doesn't change either.

That last one is quite hard to unravel,isn't it? I sorted the jumbled letters into alphabetical order, though whether that made a difference or whether it's just a toughie, I don't know.

In full (Blogger truncated my title):

&amp;quot;I thought you of all people would appreciate efforts to deconstruct the colonialist paternalistic agrarian hierarchy that disenfranchises the Tangata Whenua and erodes the natural resources of Aotearoa!&amp;quot;

Hilary is away this weekend, and Vanessa now returns home only when she wants her washing done, so the male Saunderses went to see Black Sheep , which actually marked Ruairidh's first 15 certificate at the cinema since he became old enough to see them legally. We both enjoyed it a lot: it's very silly, totally gross, and doesn't knowingly miss a single corny gag about sheep. (For example, at one point the hero fights off a were-sheep - a man who had been bitten by an experimental GM hybrid sheep - with a jar of mint sauce.) The female lead is a terribly New Age-y animal rights activist who keeps producing aromatherapy candles and reading auras (and who paralyses the aforementioned were-sheep with a skewer to an acupuncture point). Her best line comes when she and a couple of men enter a cottage whose owner has, unknown to them, been devoured by a modified sheep. They go into the kitchen and there's blood everywhere along with the signs of a violent struggle. &amp;quot;Oh...my....God....&amp;quot; she says. The others look at her. &amp;quot;The feng shui in this room is absolutely terrible!&amp;quot; (She also comes out with the line in my title, which must have taken many, many takes.)

Go and see it. It isn't great art, but it's great fun.

And there are many jokes about sex and sheep. Well, duh.

Some heartening stories - or just plain funny ones - from the past week or so:

A new neolithic village was found in Orkney . My favourite place in Scotland just got better.

(On the other hand, it just got worse .)

===========================================

Another piece of Washington trash is put out .

Gosh: Rumsfeld, Bolton, Wolfowitz and now Rove. Soon the only useless bastards left from Bush's golden boys will be the ones who were actually elected (and to my American readers, I'm sorry guys: second time round at least, it's your fault).

The first time round, of course, the decision ended up, as it should, with the Supreme Court. There is a wonderful book taking apart (&amp;quot;shredding&amp;quot; might be a better description) that Supreme Court decision, by none other than Alan Dershowitz , who is in general the last person you would suspect of being anything other than a Bush toady. I'm not sure whether this means that he became corrupted once he realised that the Bush administration supported all his own prejudices, or (more likely) whether he's a better lawyer than he is a human being. and simply couldn't keep quiet about a manifest failure of the legal system even when he benefited from it.

============================================

And this idiot kept my whole family amused. (&amp;quot;Oh my , the cage is too big. Well, I'll just put a sodding great carnivorous predator on my lap then, because that always works.&amp;quot;)

....as Star Trek's Scotty used to insist. Funnily enough, though, the "terrorism experts" who advise the Home Office seem to imagine that those laws, when applied to chemical reactions, take on a much more malleable and provisional form. The news is full right now of the trial of the men who plotted to cause "mass murder on an unimaginable scale" by using liquid explosives to destroy transatlantic aircraft.

What a pity it wouldn't work. At worst the bombers might have managed to set the aeroplane toilet on fire. If they actually made something big enough and strong enough to destroy an airliner (and the link to the article about Aloha Airlines Flight 243 shows that it ain't that easy) they'd undoubtedly have attracted suspicion when carrying their ice-packed payload aboard. Either that or they'd have made a series of neat holes in the ground when their taxis went over speed bumps.

But wait! What's this? Now we hear rather than TATP the dastardly brown chappies were planning to use HMTD . (Or maybe that was only the detonator: though why would they need one, since apparently hydrogen peroxide itself is capable of being "detonated to deadly effect".)

Let's ignore for now the game of if-we-change-the-accusations-often-enough-and-use-enough-confusing-abbreviations-people-will-stop-trying-to-follow-the-arguments-and-assume-the-experts-know-best that's going on here. Let's ignore even the fact, readily verifiable via the links above, tha HMTD and TATP share similar drawbacks for the job under consideration. Maybe slightly less fumes from HTMD synthesis, but that's all. Let's just return to our prosecutor, briefed by our government's experts in explosives and terrorism, telling us that hydrogen peroxide can be detonated. Well, here 's some information on hydrogen peroxide.

Spilling high concentration peroxide on a flammable substance can cause an immediate fire fueled by the oxygen released by the decomposing hydrogen peroxide. High strength peroxide (also called high-test peroxide, or HTP) must be stored in a vented container to prevent the buildup of oxygen gas which would otherwise lead to the eventual rupture of the container. Any container must be made of a compatible material such as PTFE, polyethylene or aluminium (not stainless steel) and undergo a cleaning process (passivation) to remove all contamination prior to the introduction of peroxide. (Note that whilst compatible at room temperature, polyethylene can explode with peroxide in a fire.)

I've seen the spilling-HTP-onto-a-piece-of-clothing trick demonstrated (when I attended my first RAF camp as an Air Training Corps cadet at school - it was part of the fuel for the air-launched nuclear missiles deployed on 617 Squadron's Vulcans.) Combustion, certainly, but no detonation. Difficult to make the stuff at home, and any attempt to smuggle that sort of hydrogen peroxide concentration in Gatorade bottles would pretty much guarantee a steep rise in London's reported cases of spontaneous human combustion. No, I think I'm more worried about policy being dictated by self-styled "explosives experts" who don't know the difference between detonation and deflagration than I am by supposed "Islamic fanatics" arrested for having flight timetables on a memory stick.

It's easy to see where this is going, though. Play on the public's ignoraance of chemistry, persuade the ignorant that this was a real plot with real explosives, then when the jury throws the whole thing out after someone explains the science to them the government can "prove" that jury trials allow "terrorists" to walk free, maybe with a side order of clever defence lawyers "confusing" the jury.

The author of the piece in The Register worried that real terrorists who do understand chemistry would be operating unhindered while the credulous oafs charged with our protection worrried about all the wrong things. Undoubtedly true, but in my opinion it' s less about catching terrorists than about discrediting due legal process.

Update: more interesting discussion here , here and especially here .

Also here , here and here .

And in case the somewhat flaky nature of the last link worries you, the British Army think it's bollocks as well.

Yes, I think Britain and the USA are finally beginning to "get it" about the "war on terror".

umm. i hate to risk sounding rude, especially after you were so nice to me above, but although i agree with you about the security theatre being just that, the materials they had really were capable of being used safely (pre-detonation :) ) and of being more than powerful enough to bring down the aircraft.

your points re deflagration vs detonation are all valid, as are the points re LONG-TERM storage of one of the ingredients pre-admixture.

nevertheless, those chemicals are more than capable of being used in the manner intended in a completely stable, safe, and near-undetectable fashion. the "secret"'s in the proportions, just like most explosives. petrol vapour (in air) is effectively inert unless spot on 10,000ppm. nitroglycerine will explode if tapped hard but dynamite can be thrown on the fire. slightly wrong gunpowder is just non-burning antibiotic batshit. give me a bag of fertiliser, a petrol station, and £1, and i can give you with 10 seconds work (and a few hours "curing" time) the globally standard industrial-strength commercial explosive-- totally stable sans detonator. (and if you're RAF-trained, you probably can too)

i've answered properly elsewhere, -- if you have 2 minutes, have a look at that post then read my comments below it .

>actually, all the professional high-yield explosives in the US (eg, used by police & FBI explosives specialists) are (clear) liquids, with slightly higher post-mix yield (by volume) than dynamite. so 300ml is more than sufficient to bring down an aircraft and even 100ml could do it if used "sensibly", eg placed & braced against the fuselage by say wedging a vial between wall & chair leg on a window seat. they are stable at quite high temperatures in a normal-living sense (eg, under summer time california sun) both before and after mixing.

so, much though i loathe security-theatre, in this case it's a valid concern.

&
>>"Some people are confusing deflagration and catalytic decomposition of peroxide mixtures with detonation. The way HTP is used as rocket fuel is not comparable to its use as an explosive. Proper HTP mixes are powerful and brisant high explosives, on a par with TNT or better. "

But as I understand it organic peroxides are not the kind of stuff you sling about gaily unless you intend to lose digits: plus acetone peroxide is a crystalline rather than a liquid. It was the precursor chemicals they were supposed to be intending to take aboard the aircraft. I don't deny that these are capable of being turned into explosives in the loo, but without lot of care and (especially) attention to cooling the mix will explode when only a little of it has actually formed the explosive end-product. By definition it will do that wherever you're trying to make your explosive, not where you'd like it to be placed to bring down the aircraft. And if you sort out the cooling somehow, the process takes longer than most tranatlantic flights.

Now if they'd smuggled aboard a load of carbon tetrachloride and sulphuric acid with the intention of gassing economy class with phosgene, I'd agree on the practicality. Or formic acid to make carbon monoxide (harder to detect, easier to treat victims). But the whole TATP thing is a non-starter.

yeah, if that was what they were going to do, all your observations are quite valid. in which case, the court case will rest on their intent to do the deed, regardless of their poor competence to fully achieve the deed. similar to if i attack you with a knife but it turns in my hand and bounces off your throat -- "attempted murder" only.

but here's the key point (which i clearly made poorly): the precise details of _exactly_ how they were intending to _use_ those chemicals was not documented and is now unlikely to be admitted to, and as is pointed out in that thread, their documentedly intended means of taking the chemicals on board was in a form which could have been the raw chemicals, or could just as easily have been preprepared chemicals in a stable but fully explosive state.

<POSTER> Rob </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> 2008-04-13T14:35:00 </POSTDATE>
I agree the court case should hinge on intent: the question is whether so much concentration on their supposedly sophisticated chemistry will end up sowing doubt in the jury's minds and getting the whole lot flung out. Which might fit with the government's overall intention but can't be good news in general. Depends precisely how the charges are framed.

You'll just have to colour me unconvinced regarding the carry-on stability of ready-mixed "clear liquid" explosives in general. However, going by what chemicals they had, our current bunch were planning to make TATP or something similar. They could have mixed it in the bath all right, but the end product is a powder (or a slurry which has to be dried out before use) not a liquid. Now if the authorities had started getting worried about baby powder and such, it would have made more sense. This guy agrees.

Of course the really dumb thing is that even with the current liquid limits a single terrorist could take on board enough dimethyl mercury (colourless, highly volatile,absorbed through the skin even with rubber gloves on, and 10 ml is a fatal dose for 10,000 people) to wipe out everyone on a plane. OK, they'd probably mostly die after landing, but the fear factor once people realise that they could be murdered without even knowing until it's too late would be huge.

I've been browsing over at Doctor Mooney's 115th Dream , a great source of free downloads, from which there is currently available a shedload of stuff from Bob Dylan's 1966 tour . Yes, I already have the CD of the Free Trade Hall concert (and yes, I was there, actually) but now by the magic of the bootleg (and Dylan fans practically invented that genre) I can hear the same songs as he did them in Liverpool, Sheffield, London, Dublin, Melbourne, Phoenix..... The quality varies, the songs don't, but the guy yelling &amp;quot;Judas!&amp;quot; belongs to Manchester alone. Go: download, before the files are deleted.

Anyway.....

Doctor Mooney also has this rather nice post about The White Stripes. There is something very cool IMHO about announcing that you're going to play one note at a (free) gig, playing it, and going home.

I am heading off tomorrow, breaking my journey at the Ballater flat, to the North-West. That's not the North-West of Great Britain, which everyone knows is full of cotton mills and black puddings * but the North-West of Scotland, full of spectacular mountains , incomparable beaches , and hundreds of thousands of seabirds . Hilary and Ruairidh are tied to school holidays, and I once more have an inconvenient holiday backlog to take. Last year I went to Warsaw: this year, the Youth Hostels at Achmelvich Beach and Durness.

DV, I shall return to blogging duties in week and a bit. Unless the weather becomes cruddy AND I find Internet access somewhere.

I've just been reading Gert's review of the Covent Garden Walküre (strictly, of Acts I and II) and I'm very jealous of her seeing PD as Siegmund.

I hope she won't mind my quoting a small extract....

And then the singing starts! At which point I realise that my binoculars, slung round my neck, are still in their case, and I have to, micron by micron, unfasten the velcro and discard the case. Then I realise that through the binoculars the stage looks very far away...yeah, I'm using them upside down. Then I realise that the four pieces of glass are grubby; the lower ones from sticky finger prints, the higher ones from make-up that comes off from around my eyes. So I have to set to and clear them, whilst never taking my eyes off the stage or my ears off the music, especially the singing, especially the singing of Siegmund. The seats in the Amphitheatre at Covent Garden are very closely packed, and any excess arm movements are very annoying to one's neighbours. Fortunately, I am blessed with permanently erect nipples which are very handy for cleaning binoculars. And I'm sure that's way too much information.

.....after which I shall never look at opera glasses in quite the same way again.

Joe - at present I use my breath and a tissue, but I shall definitely give consideration in future to taking a suitably-equipped companion for the purpose.

Udge - a little money, you think? And now I'm imagining Gert pitching this entrepreneurial idea to the panel in Dragons' Den . One might imagine a team of similarly-talented ladies accompanying the programme-sellers: the &amp;quot;Braille Surtitles&amp;quot;, perhaps, or the &amp;quot;Obbligato Eyeglasses&amp;quot;.

My friend Sue Barnard, aka Eddi the Seahorse, has created an e-petition on the 10 Downing Street site calling for identity cards to be issued free of charge if their possession is to be made compulsory. Sounds fair enough to me: I don't have any big problem with the concept of identity cards (if I was paranoid about people knowing where I was I'd never use a mobile phone). And my details already appear on countless databases: am I naive enough to think that if linking them together was desirable to the government its illegality would have stopped them up to now? (Hint: how legal was the Iraq war?) So I'm never going to get over-excited about having to carry an ID card; in fact it would be handy in some ways. (As my driving licence is one of the old ones without a photograph I have to remember to take my passport whenever I fly to Manchester for work, as I need photo ID to check in.) Being forced to pay for it, OTOH, sucks. I was under the impression that I paid taxes for that kind of thing. (What's that? All spent on the Iraq war? Tough.)

Anyway, here 's the petition. All you British citizens among my readership, go and sign it.

Go on!

Chak De India
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<POST>
<POSTER> sted by Rob @ </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> 2007-08-29T23:20:00 </POSTDATE>
Not a Film Festival showing, just one of our regular Bollywood screenings. When Hilary and Vanessa went, they were the sole Caucasians in an audience of around ten. I was one of three in an audience of around 25.

Writing this post is difficult, because I could write an informative review that would be largely incomprehensible to the BollyVirgin, or one for the general public that would miss lots out. Care needed, then.

OK, let's begin with the basics. Chak De India is a film of normal Bollywood length - around 2h40 - but with no intermission. It stars Shah Rukh Khan who is the biggest male name in Bollywood (apart from Amitabh Bachchan who is now old and being picky - in his ObiWan years, as it were). SRK, as he is known, plays Kabir Khan, a (wrongly) disgraced former captain of the Indian hockey team who takes on the challenge of coaching the Indian women's hockey team. So far, so A League Of Their Own , and Bollywood is always ready to copy a Hollywood model. Except that there's more to CDI than that. SRK - of course - moulds his women into a team, qualifies for the World Championship, and eventually wins it (come on, this is Bollywood, that isn't a spoiler!). What is interesting is the emphasis on both feminism and inter-regional prejudice in India. Feminsism: you think you know what it is, and maybe you think India does pretty well, what with Indira and Sonia and the rest. Well, the big problem in India is not so much getting women into senior mangement positions as getting women into adult life, or even into life. This is a country where pre-natal sex determination is illegal because it would lead to selective abortion of females; where a significant number of women die each year as a result of &amp;quot;dowry killings&amp;quot;, where their husband's family murders them (usually in a &amp;quot;tragic stove fire&amp;quot;) because they brought insufficient dowry with them. OK, the sexist Indian Hockey Association guys in the film are your standard Bollywood caricatures, but the film makes a big thing of being proud of being an Indian woman (&amp;quot;..because some men just don't understand that if a woman can give them life, she can do anything &amp;quot;). The film also pillories regional prejudices in India, with both the Delhi officials and other team members making all kinds of inappropriate comments on appearance, language, etc. SRK is at pains to forge a national identity for his team, and bans all mention of the women's original states. One of the actresses ( Chitrashi Rawat , who plays Komal Chautala) is a state-level hockey player in real life (for Uttaranchal) and she has said that she thinks regionalism is the biggest threat to Indian hockey. It would be great if this film changed that at all.

The film has no dance numbers; SRK doesn't cry; there are no other really big names in it (though there are some pretty hot - in all senses - newcomers among the hockey team); yet this is one of my favourite Bollywood films. It manages to deal with serious issues without being preachy, and to be funny without being trivial. People are describing SRK's performance as one of his best, and I'd second that. He isn't allowed to over-act but he clearly identifies with the part. (SRK is an Indian Muslim as is his character Kabir Khan, wrongly accused of throwing an India-Pakistan match.) Islamophobia is a problem worldwde, but one only needs to say the word Ayodhya to be reminded of its specifically Indian dimension.

Apart from its length, this could in short be the Bollywood film to convert the non-Bollywood fan. As it is, that role is probably best left to Dil Chahta Hai .

Some unpleasant reading concerning the Uzbek cotton industry , courtesy of LabourStart . I bet you thought the use of slaves to pick cotton went out with the Confederacy.

If you would like even more depressing facts about Uzbekistan, Craig Murray is your man. He used to be the British ambassador there until he showed an unacceptable level of concern over human rights violations by President Karimov at a time when Blair was frantically sucking up to him as (a) a rich foreigner with whom we could do business and (b) a partner in the &amp;quot;war on terror&amp;quot;. Obviously the inconvenient fact that he boils political opponents alive could not be allowed to put at risk all the money that Blair might make from him, especially when the opponents in question were probably Muslim anyway so had it coming, right? Hence Murray was sacked, after which the British goverment put a lot of effort into a smear campaign against him. You can read all about it in his excellent book .

And if you wondered why Craig Murray wasn't interviewed for the BBC documentary, he explains on his blog that he was in fact interviewed and filmed, but his contribution (curiously enough) was all edited out.

Blood libel from America's favourite fascist

Those of you interested in Palestinian affairs may have noticed that Philippe Karsenty is currently appealing against the verdict that he libelled the France 2 television station by accusing it of knowingly broadcasting faked footage of the shooting of Mohammed al-Durrah . Those of you who don't know what the hell I'm on about, follow the link: you probably saw the pictures even if you don't recognise the name.

I have to say that there are unanswered questions about the footage, and while I wouldn't go as far as some of the Zionist nutters who claim the boy was murdered by the Palestinians as a photo-op, I'm not totally convinced by what I've seen so far.

However.

Here is Frontpage Magazine, run by (among others) David Horowitz whom we last saw organising fascist rallies in American universities . (As its blogroll is proudly headed up by such luminaries as Little Green Footballs and Benjamin &amp;quot;Cunt&amp;quot; Kerstein , the magazine clearly holds his values dear.) In its article on the al-Durrah affair (reckoning the while thing was a fake rather than a genuine killing by anyone) we find this interesting statement:

Two weeks after the Al Durrah tapes aired, two Jewish soldiers lost their way in Ramallah, where they were savagely beaten to death, their innards eaten by hysterical and frenzied crowds screaming Allah Akbar--God is great--and seeking revenge for the supposed death of the boy.

You will seek in vain for corroboration of this extraordinary statement, either on the FrontPage site or anywhere else, as it is (shock!) a total fabrication. (Hint: Muslims don't eat offal or blood even from non-human sources.) As you will for any retraction or apology from the fascists who made it. I often wondered what would be the most perfect analogy for the old anti-Semitic &amp;quot;blood libel&amp;quot; that Jews used the blood of murdered Christians to make their Passover matzohs. Well, now I know.

Funny, isn't it, that it is these flagrant liars and bigots who make the most noise about anti-Semitic untruths?

Anyway, if the Home Office want to keep dangerous extremists out of Britain, they could start with this piece of offal (currently still in possession of all her blood) - the one responsible for the piece of filth Horowitz's site endorsed. And follow up with Horowitz himself.

( Udge recently described my blog, delightfully, as comprising "music and outrage". So after a couple of musical posts, here comes some of the other stuff. )

This article by Jonathan Freedland in Saturday's Guardian decsribes the activities of a group of Jewish vigilantes (the Nokmim , led by Abba Kovner) in the aftermath of the second World War, who set out like so many Dexter Morgan s, to bring summary justice to Nazi murderers who had evaded justice.

While I oppose the death penalty I can understand and sympathise with them to some extent, or could have if that were all they had done. Dexter, after all, followed the "Code of Harry", ensuring that he killed only those who he believed truly deserved death. But not content with finding Nazis who had fled justice, the Nokmim carried out the mass murder of several hundred SS men who had been captured and were already in prison:

But the Avengers did not confine themselves to individual executions. Their largest operation was aimed at Stalag 13, a detention centre for former SS men in Nuremberg. The Vengeance group discovered that bread for the detainees was supplied by a single bakery. One of their younger members, Arye Distel, who had blue eyes and Aryan looks, got a job as a trainee baker, then worked up a plan to poison one morning's consignment of loaves.

Once they had got hold of the lethal fluid - which they codenamed "medication" - Distel smuggled it over several days into the bakery, stashing the bottles under the floorboards. Harmatz describes how, on a Saturday, at the change of shift, three extra comrades crept inside to join Distel, and together they brushed the poison on to some 3,000 loaves.

Did it work? Just check the New York Times for April 20 1946, where on page six you will find an Associated Press report that begins as follows: "Nineteen hundred German prisoners of war were poisoned by arsenic in their bread early this week in a United States camp and all are 'seriously ill', United States headquarters announced tonight." How many of those SS men actually died following the poisoning at Stalag 13 has never been verified, but some put the figure at several hundred, others at a thousand.

Yet according to Freedland that was only "Plan B", the fallback, a substitute for a plan to poison the water supplies of Munich, Berlin, Weimar, Nuremburg and Hamburg, indiscriminately murdering millions.

Kovner sought moral backing for his project, travelling to Palestine to consult the leaders of the Jewish state-in-waiting. He met Chaim Weizmann, who would become Israel's first president and who had begun his career (at Manchester University) as a research chemist. Once Weizmann heard from Kovner the horrors of the Holocaust, he could mount no resistance: he gave his blessing to the Avengers, even offering them help in acquiring the poison. (Several sources suggest Weizmann approved only Plan B, rather than the more deadly, and arbitrary, Plan A.)

In fairness to the nascent state of Israel, there seem to have been a number of senior Zionists who possessed either a moral sense or a consciousness of the need to appear better than the Nazis in some respects at least. Abba Kovner and his genocidal band were betrayed before they could achieve the millions of dead Germans they craved.

Yet there seem to be plenty of people, including Freedland to judge from his article, who consider Kovner and the Nokmim to be some kind of band of heroes:

The story of the Avengers has not yet become a central part of the Holocaust narrative. That may have disappointed Kovner, who died in 1987. One former comrade, Gabik Sedlis, told Cohen that the leader kept one eye on his place in history, hoping to be ranked alongside the ancient defenders of the Jewish people. "Two thousand years from now, he wanted people to talk about Judah Maccabee and Abba Kovner."

That goal has not yet been realised. But it might be, if at least the work of the Nokmim gets what those men and women wanted for themselves and their fellow Jews - if, in other words, future generations do their story justice.

If future generations "do their story justice", people will talk about Adolf Hitler and Abba Kovner as thwarted agents of genocide. And mourn neither of them.

Jocelyn Lavin over at 2nd Altos Like The Bottom Parts posts a few very interesting links.

First this one explaining how the fireworks for the Edinburgh Festival fireworks concerts are synchronised with the music (and explaining why the famous &amp;quot;waterfall&amp;quot; effect didn't appear this year until right at the end!).

Then an informative and funny A-Z guide to Wagner's Ring cycle .

Jocelyn links to a Youtube video about how to write a fugue based on Britney Spears' &amp;quot;Oops, I Did It Again&amp;quot;. I didn't think that much of the video, but the Youtube entry linked to the fugue itself as a pdf file . Enjoy (especially if you play piano).

But the best one, which made me laugh out loud a lot , was this rider (i.e. list of equipment and other requirements for a concert) written by roadie Jos Grain for Iggy Pop and the Stooges. 18 pages long and every one a gem. (Well, OK, page 7 sags a bit....)

Although I have a fairly low tolerance when it comes to contemporary comedy (I lasted about two minutes when attempting to listen to this week's The Hollow Men , which seemed like some dreadful throwback to the days of Bernard Manning ) I very much enjoyed this clip from the Armstrong and Miller Show (thanks to J.J. ).

Nope, I definitely can't get her to reverse. I wondered if her shadow was the issue, which I can't imagine being anticlockwise because of where in the circle it vanishes, but even if I crop the screen so there's no shadow I still can't get it to flip.

Woo! Just managed to flip it! If I gradually uncover the image from the feet upwards and concentrate very hard on the feet I can make it reverse. But it I close my eyes and open them again it goes back to clockwise and I have to go through the whole procedure again.

Interestingly, my left-handed wife sees it as clockwise, my left-handed son as anti-clockwise.

Edinburgh Film Festival Tuesday 24 June - The Art Star and the Sudanese Twins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<POST>

So there's this rather pretentious creator of artistic installations who visits Sudan while one of her own children is still small. She encounters a couple of tiny children being looked after in a Christian refuge because their father can't cope (their mother died in childbirth). The nuns ask her if she could breast-feed them, and she does, and the resulting bond works on her mind to the extent that she becomes determined to adopt them. This proves problematical as Sudan has no legal adoption (extended families step in if parents die). However, with determination, a thick skin and a health dose of self-belief Vanessa Beecroft eventually gets through the jungle of paperwork to the point where she is almost able to adopt the children. By this point the sudience have moved (if I was typical) from viewing her as a trendy New Yorker wanting a third world trophy baby to a loving, caring (if somewhat weird) mother. At this point, though, we discover that she has neglected to mention her adoption plan to her husband, who is unimpressed. As his signature is needed for all the paperwork at the US end that spells disaster. He does suggest that if she is determined she could divorce him, whereupon the law aould allow her to adopt by herself, but she doesn't want to abandon her own two children (and one can only applaud her belated attack of common sense). The film ends with the couple still married; with her having to some extent sublmated her maternal urghes into her work; and with her making what was evidently one of a regular series of visits to the twins (who could hardly have been more photogenic had they been selected for it) to provide assitance of a more godmotherly (and material) kind.

But I swear as we all realised she'd never mentioned the plan to her husband you could hear several hundred Edinburgh jaws hitting the floor.....

At the start of the film I had a niggling feeling that the name Vanessa Beecroft was familar, but it was only when they showed pictures of some of her installations , which feature live human models, that I recognised her style. I remembered this picture (NSFW), which for some strange reason appears on various web sites not generally associated with high art. (Though one might argue that it displays Vanessa's bottomless well of inspiration.... )

While digging out stuff on Chak De India I found this great website for Bollywood neophytes. Full of great nuggets, though my personal favourite so far has to be this spoof Bollywood song . Even if you've never seen a Bollywood film, I think you'll get the idea of what the parody is all about.

In his Saturday column in the Guardian , Simon Hoggart mentions a book by Christopher Booker and Richard North, Scared To Death , which discusses various media-hyped scare stories including &amp;quot;the most perfect scare of all, the Y2K or millennium bug terror, which was going to end civilisation.......In the end, among other minuscule catastrophes, some bus ticket machines in Australia failed to work.&amp;quot;

We in the IT profession have become used to taking the blame when highly-visible SNAFUs occur, and to being taken for granted when our efforts mean they don't. With Y2K, though, we weren't so much taken for granted as accused of having manufactured the while thing as a way of boosting our earnings. Ed Yourdon (a demigod to coders of a certain age!) made some pertinent observations right back on 1/1/2000. But I think the best rebuttal of the Hoggarts is to be had by looking at the birds and the B(MW)s. Let me explain.

Back in 1972, the environmental movement was just gathering momentum. Edward Goldsmith came and gave a talk at my school in which he discussed the Club of Rome 's report Limits To Growth , on which his magazine The Ecologist had just run a feature. This was the famous report that informed us all that the world's oil would run out in 1992. (As you can see from the link, it wasn't quite that simple in fact, but the environmentalists themselves were happy to be misinterpreted in that way as it garnered more attention). Ten years earlier, Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring had alerted the world to the devastating environmental effects of pesticides, and painted a bleak picture of a future where many species such as peregrine falcons would be wiped out.

Well, as you can see, it didn't happen. There's still plenty of oil and plenty of peregrines. So where did it all go right? It went right precisely because of Rachel Carson and the Club of Rome. People read Silent Spring and suddenly became much more aware of the toxic stuff (to humans too in many cases) they were scattering around their houses and onto their crops. So they stopped using them. Not overnight, and not totally, but to a considerable extent. Limits To Growth told the oil companies nothing they didn't already know, but suddenly their investors were more easily persuaded to put money into prospecting in places where extracting the oil might be expensive, and into developing fancy techniques to permit such extraction. (A friend of mine wrote a text-book back in the 1980s on drilling round corners: in 1970 there would have been little market for it.) As the price of oil rose thanks to OPEC's machinations, it became steadily more economical to extract oil from unlikely sources, and new supplies kept on coming onstream.

So both Silent Spring and Limits To Growth were wrong in the end, and were wrong because they had first been right, and been taken seriously. If they'd been dismissed as more cranks (as they were by some folk) then we'd be living in a different world today. In the same way, if nobody had taken the Y2K bug seriously there would have been some rather worse things happening on 1st January 2000 (or maybe 4th January, or 29 February) than bus ticket machines failing. In Bank of Scotland, for example, the first sign of the approaching millennium was in (I think) 1998 when the first batch of Visa cards with an expiry date of 1900 was produced. That was easy to fix (give all new cards a two-year rather than three-year life) but provided a concrete example of the kind of thing we were working to prevent. Over the life of the Y2K project (on which I was one of the lead testers for the bank's batch systems) we uncovered a few instances of actual Y2K bugs, none of them dramatic, but by the time 2000 rolled around we could be pretty sure that we weren't going to encounter serious problems. And when I say serious, remember that the entire banking system, world-wide, depends on the electronic transmission of money; that these transactions all have date and time stamps; and that a transaction coming in with the wrong date will usually be rejected. Or imagine that the program calculating how much interest you owed on your mortgage decided that between 31st December 1999 and 4th January 2000 you'd accrued 36,528 days' worth instead of four.

So poke fun all you like, Messrs Booker and North. I'm happy to have done my job so well you never noticed.

Oh, and don't all post comments telling me that the year 2000 wasn't the millennium, because I'm well aware of that. That's why I call it the Y2K bug, not the millennium bug.

I wonder if anyone's collecting examples of surviving Y2K bugs? Earlier this year I came across a Web form which insisted on entering the year as 19107 - which, of course, failed validation.

And of course we all earned a fortune out of it didn't we. Well didn't we? I did a 12 hour day on 1/1/2000 from 7am. I got Saturday pay. Nothing happened apart from we all got a bit skittish on sugar because the only thing to eat was doughnuts as our employers had insisted we work but had decided not to ask any catering staff to do the same.

I had to set up a test where we ran as much of the work of the first business day of 2000 as was available at 31/12/1999, in the window of genuine two-thousandness before the first working day of 2000 actually rolled round. We dry-ran it over the August 1999 Bank Holiday weekend and found various operational glitches which were duly fixed before the real thing. I didn't make a fortune out of it (I've worked on more lucrative projects) but I did get overtime for both the August BH and for the millennium period. The seriously lucrative overtime rates kicked in IIRC for six hours each side of the Y2K midnight, and I did in fact have to go into work for about an hour and a half late on Hognanay to download some files. That was nice. Because of what I needed to do with those files, I had to be accompanied by a female colleague from another department who is best described in the immortal words of Duckman: &amp;quot;Hummana Hummana Howwa !&amp;quot; I have to say, as I sat there basking in her glow and downloading files at some unearthly hourly rate, I did think life was quite good.....

Mostly, though, it was a normal weekend overtime rate. And no, we didn't get any catering provided (though I've done other weekend mega-shifts for projects where quite decent facilities were made available).

I worked for Netscape at the time. In April 1999 they cancelled all end of year holidays. Since I'd already booked my time to be here in Edinburgh I offered my resignation.

Instead they offered me a chance to work remote (sweeeeet). When it came to be Dec 31, 1999 - 11pm (US version of the date...) I was standing on Princes St waiting for the fireworks. At 6am the following morning, I was logging into my computer to see if all was well with the world - and answer questions if there were any. There weren't any... and so I took my fairly drunk body to bed.

The time between April and December had been spent creating &amp;quot;fixes&amp;quot; to avert any issues that might arise on Jan 1, 2000 - so when it came, there were no issues left.

Unfortunately, my co-workers were required to be at their desks rather than taking in the parties in California. Through some grace, I was allowed my holiday (and actually paid for it - as I was &amp;quot;technically&amp;quot; working). What most of the management doesn't know is that the workers knew the problem wasn't a problem - but management didn't want to listen to us.

Sputnik 1 was launched fifty years ago, when I was just too young to appreciate it. And when I say just too young, I do remember Sputnik 2 (incorporating Laika the Dog) which was launched on 3 November the same year, which must surely be the earliest news item I can recall. I expect my mother chatted about it to me; its having a dog in it would have made it more interesting to her (and of course to tiny me) than a mere bleeping sphere.

I found this blog by accident (its owner posted a comment just above one of mine on EKN regular Phil's blog The Gaping Silence ). A German political blog sounds promising in any case, but what brought me to a gobsmacked halt was this post on the questionnaire sent to the long-term unemployed by Hamburg City Council (among others). The council withdrew it: I wonder if withdrawal was preceded by the kind of outcry I suspect we'd get in Britain under similar circumstances?

Incidentally the post of Phil's where I read KMS's comment is worth reading too. Very often Phil's posts leave me feeling rather awestruck, and I slink away wishing that I'd got round to reading Das Kapital (and that's not an emotion too easily aroused) or consoling myself that however bottomless my ignorance on some matters where Phil is clearly very well-informed, I can probably give him a decent contest on Schoenberg chamber music, St Kilda, or sulphur-nitrogen compounds. (Actually, the last was more for alliterative effect: while that was a set of undergraduate lectures I didn't sleep through I don't think I've actually retained very much of them.) Anyway, this post of Phil's crossed into an area I actually know something about: Phil may have recently become a folkie, but I - lapsed though I am these days as a performer - was putting in the hours on stage with my fiddle, and occasional (guitar, vocals), when I was still at school 35 years ago. My finest hour was being part (to wit, fiddle) of a hastily-assembled band led by Trevor Crozier (author of &amp;quot;Don't Tell I, Tell 'Ee&amp;quot;) and Joe Beard (formerly of The Purple Gang) which actually achieved a slot on Main Stage 2 at the Cambridge Folk Festival in (I think) 1976. Introduced by Martin Carthy, followed by The High Level Ranters, my seven minutes or so on stage passed as in a dream. Anyway, for once, therefore, I actually had something coherent to write in a comment!

1. I haven't read Capital (I've read bits of it, and very good they were too, but any leftish dilettante or Politics student could say as much).

2. I haven't recently become a folkie. It's four and a half years now since I started doing it regularly (February 2003; I did &amp;quot;Sally free and easy&amp;quot; in an E L Wisty raincoat). According to my trusty song/performance spreadsheet I've now Got Up about 120 times in all.

3. I know very little about St Kilda and next to nothing about Schoenberg, so you might be on to something there.

4. Cheers. I dream of progressing beyond the floor spot, but it would probably take more effort than I'm prepared to put in.

OK, it is recent compared with the first time I sang something traditional in public (1984), the first time I sang anything in public (1980) or the first Steeleye Span album I bought (1973). But it's felt like quite a long haul to me.

Clare is no longer hugely pregnant, but is instead hugely relieved at having produced little (well, ish) Oscar, and moreover at having done so without the need for cranes, dry docks, stirrups, helicopters, or any of the laser-guided wossnames and power-assisted doo-wops that are so frequently called upon when ladies shaped like puffballs discover that babies are harder to shift than spores. Congratulations to her and Ally, and I hope Felix enjoys his new little brother. And let's not forget Dipsy the dog, liable to have his nose put severely out of joint by the new rival for attention.

Some of my readers (Udge, for example) will have divined from the title what this post is to be about. The rest of you will have to wait a moment or two.

Hands up if you remember Freddie Frinton. For a Brit younger than me, don't bother: you won't. he was a comic who died in 1968. For my generation, he had a brief flowering of fame in a TV sitcom with Thora Hird entitled Meet The Wife . Ah, there go a few hands.

So how is it that Freddie Frinton is a household name in Scandinavia, and in German-speaking Europe? Well, a few years before he died, he recorded a sketch called Dinner For One , which is officially (according to the Guinness Book of Records) the most-repeated television programme of all time. It is shown on New Year's Eve in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, on several channels, every year. In Scandinavia it is shown on 23 December. In Britain, meanwhile, it has never been screened at all.

Here is the Wikipedia entry for the programme, and here is the programme itself (the full 18 minute version as generally shown).

I'm not sure what amazes me more: that a programme which is so incredibly popular abroad has never been shown in Britain, or that an 18 minute film, in English, without subtitles or dubbing, became - and remains - a cult hit in Germany and Scandinavia. How much interest would there be, do you think, in Britain for a similar sketch, even one in colour and less dated, if it were recorded in German and given no dubbing or titles? I can tell you, it wouldn't even get one showing. I'm prepared to bet that I've had visitors who took one look at my recent video posts of France Gall and Sarek and bailed out because they were in French / Swedish with no translation provided. (But you see, here at EKN we have faith in the intelligence, curiosity and persistence of our readers.)

Well, it is an accomplished piece of comic business, though very dated in style. It reminds me very much of one of the late great Michael Bentine's (audio-only) sketches, The Toast-Master, in which the eponymous MC has to propose toasts to a large number of difficult-to-pronounce dignitaries, and becomes gradually more and more drunk. Bentine, of course, was in a class of his own.

A sober analysis of the likely effects of an American attack on Iran. The author assumes a non-nuclear attack at first: apparently the US government is moving away from the idea of targetting the nuclear facilities.

Now that makes me go &amp;quot;Hmmmm&amp;quot;.....

P.S. When I was checking EKN's ranking in the Truth Laid Bear ecosystem , I was puzzled to discover that The Huffington Post, which had been in the top three last time I looked, was nowhere to be seen. Looking deeper, I found it listed as number 1 but &amp;quot;inactive&amp;quot;. As it has posts with today's date, and no obvious recent gaps, I wonder how it counts as inactive. One might be tempted to consider that as the front-runner is now Michelle Malkin's blog there has been political bias at work. While that may be true - number three, after all, is the vile Little Green Footballs hate site - the entry separating them is The Daily Kos, an avowedly &amp;quot;liberal&amp;quot; blog. There's clearly something sinister going on, but I haven't worked it out yet. Any suggestions?

On Tuesday evening my regular quartet, augmented by my wife Hilary on piano, played at Edinburgh Music Club. Rebecca, our usual viola player, switched for the occasion to harmonium (or its digital equivalent) and we played Arnold Schoenberg's Weihnachtsmusik . Schoenberg write the piece in 1921 for a domestic occasion of some kind (one assumes at Christmas time), and it's a fantasia on the two Christmas carols Es ist ein Ros' Entsprungen and Silent Night. (Clever of Schoenberg to spot that the two tunes have similar shapes.) It went pretty well, in fact: the piano part is by no means easy, and there are ensemble problems to be overcome at the end. We were a little surprised, then, when we finished and received no applause until Hilary said &amp;quot;That's it!&amp;quot;.

Subsequent discussion with (generally enthusiastic) audience members suggested that they had for the most part failed to detect Silent Night in the mix. It appears only in the piano part (which is quite an ingenious arrangement) and is always embellished with a certain amount of triplet figuration. It seemed pretty obvious to us, and we know we got the balance OK with the piano. Anyway, we think the audience were all waiting for Silent Night to appear, hence their silence.

With the wonder that is the Internet, you can decide. Here is a recording of Weihnachtsmusik (not by us). I bet you spot Silent Night . Remember it's only in the piano, and first appears about half way through (3:28 to be exact). (I note that whoever labelled the Youtube clip also failed to register that there are two carols involved. Sigh.)

Enjoy the piece anyway: it's thoroughly charming and deserves to be heard more. Last Christmas it was played on Classic FM, so I'm not its only champion.

Special thanks to Chip and Eddie of Ed's World who came along to support. I like to think they spotted SN but stayed quiet so as not to embarrass less careful listeners.....

Actually... I had spotted the Silent Night... but the piece had put me in such a lovely reverie that I literally forgot to applaud. When Hilary said 'that's it' I came back from my Winter Wonderland with a bit of a jolt. We enjoyed it very much!

It was a lovely concert and I felt the highlight was the Schoenberg piece.

Why didn't I applaud right away? I was still enjoying the atmosphere of the music, while it had ended the feeling had not. It takes a while to come back to responses after that. The silence was (in my part) a compliment to the players and the music.

Chuck Palahniuk, Book Festival, 16 August

This wasn't my first visit to the Book Festival this year: I'd been to see Iain Banks a few days earlier, and while he was as delightful as ever I didn't feel I'd anything much to write about him.

Not so Chuck Palahniuk. I'd never read any of his books, knowing him only by reputation (never even saw the film of Fight Club ), so wasn't sure what to expect.

Things I didn't expect: proceedings kicking off with Chuck and his interviewer hurling several dozen cheap inflatable sex dolls into the audience and having a competition to see who could blow one up fastest. (Two separate prizes as the male dolls were easier to blow up.) I should add that while the dolls were clearly make and female they lacked orifices, whch could be why they were cheap. The prizes were DVDs of Chuck's favourite horror movie (sadly I didn't catch the title, but he said he preferred to watch parts of it with the sound off).

Then we were given a choice of readings. Chuck does a lot of literary events, and likes to read unpublished work at them so people feel they've had something more than they could have had by just reading a book themselves. he gave us the choice of (1) a new piece or (2) a piece called Guts which he had read to great acclaim in Brighton recently. We chose (1) - it seems Guts is on YouTube anyway - so he read us a piece called Loser , about a guy undergoing a fraternity initiation consisting of taking part in a TV game show while tripping on blotter acid. Stylistically quite different from Hunter S Thompson, but his kind of story, I thought.

(Update: I have since discovered that Guts is published in CP's collection Haunted . Also, he has read Guts at a number of forums, and at almost every one members of the audience have fainted. Here's why. )

Next it was Q & A time. Anyone asking a question got another doll for a further competition round. How did he come up with story ideas? He likes to start with a concrete physical sensation and take it from there. Every answer was fringed with marvellous anecdotes, so that for example by the end we knew about apprentice initiations ranging from TV studio technicians to French veterinarians.

Finally, more dolls, more DVDs, and we were out, watching with amusement looks on other festivalgoers faces as we stuffed deflated plastic people into our bags.

Recommended reading: Survivor. I read it stood up in Waterstones (for shame) but I just couldn't put it down. In defence I'm sure you would attest we do buy a LOT of books...

More New York wingnuts, and now it's the turn of Judith Weiss, Wingnut-Commander at Kesher Talk . She banned me last week from further commenting on her blog, a story with a beginning that made me furious and an end that still keeps me laughing. Ready?

Unsurprisingly, in the week following the Israeli sneak attack on Syria , Kesher Talk was silent at first and then posted a &amp;quot;that will teach them a lesson&amp;quot; piece. (Funny, isn't it, how these people are the first to insist that any supporter of Palestinian rights must instantly condemn any act of terrorism committed by a Palestinian or lose credibility, when they not only fail to condemn terrorist acts by Israeli forces but try to justify them.)

Anyway, in KT's week of cheerleading for terror, Judith linked to a blog called 4 Mile Creek (I'm not linking to him, but it's his 19 July 2006 post &amp;quot;If I were Going To Attack Iran&amp;quot;). Judith's is the only link showing on his list of linked sites, and probably the reason for that is that not only does he encourage an attack on Iran (currently not at war with anyone) but he blithely advocates use of disguised aircraft and the slaughtering of a few hundred Saudis simply to save the effort of air-to-air refuelling. (To give context here, the only attacks on Iran Israel has admitted to considering is attacks on its nuclear facilities. The only way to attack those facilities is by means of nuclear weaponry becase of the depth of protection they have, and that is what Israel is considering . Let's leave aside the fact that the Iranian plants have been inspected and found weapons-free, while Israel, which possesses atomic bombs, not only has never permitted international inspection but abducted, imprisoned, and continues to persecute the heroic man who told the world about its undeclared Weapons of Mass Destruction. Sweet.)

So, this post advocating crawling over a few hundred murdered Saudis to launch a sneak nuclear first strike on Iran, Judith described in her linking post as Department of &amp;quot;Things that make you go hmmmmm&amp;quot; . Also as &amp;quot;intriguing&amp;quot;. Nothing more (and remember, she's the only blogger who's ever linked to the filthy piece). You may imagine that I became a little incensed. You'd be correct.

I posted a comment including the following (two typos corrected):

If such a vile thing were to occur, then Israel would fully deserve to be obliterated by nuclear, biological, chemical and any other kind of weaponry, and the nations of the world would be queeing up to do it. Is that what you want?

With hindsight, the word &amp;quot;obliterate&amp;quot; might perhaps have been improved on, though as it was Israel's erasure from the map as a political entity I had in mind rather than some kind of mass extermination it was in fact precisely what I meant. That such a retaliation should be expected is not an original thought: Judith herself (5th January 2006: The Coming Showdown With Iran&amp;quot;) quotes Ariel Sharon of all people saying essentially the same thing, which is why he opposed launching such an attack.

Anyway, Judith herself went nuclear, which is where it becomes pretty funny. Apparently I was &amp;quot;advocating the most horrible kind of genocide as a punishment for defending against attempted genocide&amp;quot;. Note especially that the killing of Jews is twice described as genocide, while the killing by nuclear immolation of Iranians is.....oh, that's right, ignored totally. Airbrushed out of the picture. Sick.

Apparently my disgust at the cowardly bombing of Syria and my disinclination to have swathes of Iran levelled at Olmert's whim shows that I &amp;quot;defend totalitarian scumbags and their attempts at genocide&amp;quot;. Hmm. Don't remember Assad or Ahmadinejad attempting genocide. Still, what do I know? I'm a &amp;quot;fascist&amp;quot;. Also a &amp;quot;Stalinist&amp;quot;, a &amp;quot;solialist&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;George Galloway clone&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;eagerly sucking genocidal dictators' cocks&amp;quot; like all the rest of the &amp;quot;British Left&amp;quot;. I thought it exceptionally amusing that like her fellow-traveller Benjamin Kerstein her response to criticism is to descend to the good old obscene ad hominem. Well, that and banning any further criticism.

A few more chuckles, and a few easily-checked lies (but who cares when you've banned the person you're lying about?) and then we're done with the Islamophobic goose-steppers at KT.

Chuckle #1

Apparently I &amp;quot;hated Cinnamon and Benjamin for some reason, maybe because they could run rhetorical rings round him without breaking sweat&amp;quot;.

Regular readers here will remember Benjamin , whose supposed rhetorical skills were seen to comprise:

(a) loftily declaring that the basic error of fact that rendered his so-called &amp;quot;novel&amp;quot; as stupid as if he'd placed San Francisco in Illinois was irrelevant;
(b) when I persisted, calling me a &amp;quot;pathetic little neo-Nazi cunt&amp;quot;;
(c) making obscene comments about other members of my family - only (get the rhetorical ring-running) doing it in Hebrew !

Yeah, I'm really scared of Benjamin's debating skills.

The comment about Cinnamon is even funnier, as while I've posted a few comments on posts of hers at Kesher Talk, she has never responded to any of them so far as I am aware. Her only acknowledgement of my existence was a comment on Judith's rug-chewing look-at-me-I'm-clever-I've-banned-Rob post. It reads, in full: Buh-bye, Rob. You won't be missed! So in fact I've no idea whether Cinnamon has any debating skills at all. She's certainly never treated me to a display of them.

Judith clearly sets the bar extremely low for rhetoric (though we can see that from her own attempts thereat).

Chuckle #2

Apparently I suffer from &amp;quot;overweening arrogance&amp;quot;. Judith declares that the bombing of the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor was &amp;quot;an act that every middle east nation was grateful for, whether they were willing to admit it or not&amp;quot;. So claiming to know the opinions of every West Asian government better than they do themselves: that isn't arrogance? Oh, and this arrogant idiot can read the future, and it tells her how omniscient she will remain about other governments' wishes, as &amp;quot;every Arab state will be grateful&amp;quot; if Israel nukes Iran, as will &amp;quot;most of Europe&amp;quot;. Right.....(edges away from the loony lady...)

Dumbass Easy-To-Spot Lie #1

Someone commented supportively (and no, it wasn't me under an alias, or anyone I know) that You write that Israel should attack Iran and &amp;quot;strike nearly anywhere in Iran&amp;quot;. When Rob writes that Israel will deserve to be attacked back again you ban him. Judith's reply? I never wrote &amp;quot;Israel should strike nearly anywhere in Iran&amp;quot;. And I don't know anyone who thinks that would be a good idea. Well, the author of the piece that made her go Hmmmmm clearly does, because he does talk about striking anywhere in Iran. Moreover, as well as just linking to it, she pasted the quote into her blog post! How stupid does this woman think her readers are? How stupid is she?

Dumbass Easy-To-Spot Lie #2

Let's humour the poor woman for a moment and assume that I was encouraging (rather than predicting) a nuclear retaliation on Israel. Assume also that such retaliation actually killed every Jew in Israel. (Which it clearly wouldn't , but that' s Weissian rhetoric for you. She also thinks it would done with a single bomb, which is so idiotic I can find no way to ridicule it further.) Apparently, then, I advocate &amp;quot;eradicating half the world's Jews, more than Hitler murdered&amp;quot;.

Ahem . And again .

In 2006 Israel contained only 40.6% of the world's Jews. If Judith could count, she would know that 'half' is 50%. A lie, then. And as at 24 April 2007, total number of Jews in Israel = 5,415,000. Are we expected to take seriously a supposed Jew who pontificates about genocide but doesn't even know that Hitler killed six million Jews in the Holocaust? I wonder which 10% of those murders she thinks didn't happen. Perhaps if they were &amp;quot;solialists&amp;quot; or homosexuals they didn't count.

Dumbass Easy-To-Spot Lie #3

This one really was worth waiting for. I referred to Israel's previous acts of aggression, including &amp;quot;the days when you bombed Baghdad&amp;quot;. Judith's response:

Israel bombed Baghdad? In your alternate universe maybe.... One more &amp;quot;fact&amp;quot; from your fevered imagination. (You probably meant the Osirak reactor, which was in Iraq's Western desert - can you read a map?)

Well, yes, I did mean the Osirak reactor. And I can read a map. Osirak was at the al-Tuwaitha complex , around 11 miles SSE of Baghdad on a bend in the Tigris (i.e. closer to Baghdad than Kennedy Airport is to New York). Reading a map, I would say that as Baghdad is pretty far East in Iraq, that put Osirak around 200 miles from the Western Desert, which is, you know, in the West of Iraq. But Judith wouldn't know that because she can't read a map.

Being wrong is one thing. Being stupidly wrong is another. And drawing attention to your stupid wrongness to try to score a cheap point: well, that must be Judith running rhetorical rings round me.

Buh-bye, horse's ass. You won't be missed!

I referred in one of my comments on KT to Israel's sinking of the USS Liberty. This should of course have read &amp;quot;attempted sinking&amp;quot;, as the Liberty was crippled but survived, unlike 34 of her crew. She survived rocket attacks from three aircraft, a torpedo strike, and for good measure the machine-gunning of her life-rafts.

But someone will undoubtedly point out that she didn't sink.

Apologies for the error.

With impeccable timing, I became a Kula Shaker fan a matter of a couple of months before the band broke up, a trick I also achieved with the Boo Radleys. So when I noticed that they had reformed and were touring I was very pleased indeed. I had no idea of what to expect from them live: did they tour with half a sub-continent of shehnai players, or would they have turned their backs on the old material in favour of stuff from the new album?

In the event, they entered in the wake of a video collage of the flogging scene from If , nuclear tests and Wicked Witch of the West, with Crispian Mills dressed in tails in homage to the If schoolboys. There were just four of them, and as well as doing several new songs they threw themselves enthusiastically into a lot of the old stuff. They opened up with Hey Dude , and followed it with Jerry Was There and a performance of Shower Your Love which took on a whole new aspect from being shorn of all its Indian musical trappings. They worked extremely hard, and had the audience eating out of their hands pretty much from the beginning. I had wondered whether their following would turn out to be mostly ageing hippies of my generation, but they clearly have a young audience as well, and the largely student crowd at QMU responded joyfully. I hadn't heard Kula Shaker cover Deep Purple's Hush before, but clearly most of the audience had (I gather they do it on the soundtrack of I Know What You Did Last Summer ) and went wild. Other songs I recognised were Tattva , Into The Deep , and a final segue from Great Hosanna into Govinda in which they were lustily joined by the audience. They came back to do a belting Sound Of Drums before running up against QMU's fairly rigid closedown time and having to finish.

Mention must be made of the two supports. Firstly we had Ivyrise who were well worth turning up early enough to see; then the amazing Dr Joel , who would have been worth going to see all by himself. One of the reviews on his Myspace site describes him as the &amp;quot;Ivor Cutler of the subcontinent&amp;quot;, which captures part of his charm exactly, though it misses his vocal percussion skill and the sheer good humour of the man. I shall look out for him in future.

Thinking of oddball solo performers with quirky lyrics suddenly had me trying to imagine a collaboration between Dr Joel and Thomas Truax . I think they might be rather a good fit, actually, and I'd pay serious money to see it. If you're reading this, guys, think about it, OK?

Should we expect those loud-mouthed champions of academic freedom Alan Dershowitz and Steven Weinberg to speak out against the disgusting abrogation thereof on their own doorstep at DePaul University?

Hardly, since Dershowitz was one of the instigators of the witch-hunt against Norman Finkelstein, and Weinberg wouldn't recognise academic freedom ( or any other kind ) if it was rammed up his racist rump.

Still, at least there are evidently enough decent Americans to stand up and be counted against the cowardly Ds and Ws. I'm proud that we Brits have some involvement with the campaign (Tariq Ali is hosting the public meeting).

BTW, I can't help noticing that Alan Dershowitz and Anthony Julius don't seem to have done very well at bankrupting British academia just yet. Perhaps they have targeting accuracy similar to that of US pilots in Afghanistan and Iraq , or the IDF in Palestine , and have instead managed to cause the collapse of the US sub-prime mortgage sector.

Clive Stafford Smith - Edinburgh Book Festival 23 August 2007

<POST>

An inspiring session with Clive Stafford Smith. Until comparatively recently, Clive was best known for his work as a lawyer with Reprieve, the charity representing prisoners on Death Row in the USA (he's half-American, half-British and is a US citizen). Over the past few years, though, he has represented around forty prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, most famously Moazzam Begg who was at last year's Book Festival . Well, today he inspired several hundred people in Edinburgh (many of whom I was pleased to note provided email addresses for Reprieve's campagn materials). His Powerpoint presentation wasn't working, but it didn't seem to cramp his style at all. He was in Edinburgh today to give a presentation to the Scottish Parliament (or one of its committees) of evidence that - despite Westminster denials - Prestwick Airport has indeed been repeatedly used by the CIA for its &amp;quot;rendition&amp;quot; flights (i.e. kidnapping people and taking them across borders without extradition warrants so they can be tortured more readily). CSS, incidentally, was scathing about US government euphemisms, suc as &amp;quot;rendition&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;kidnapping&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;detainee&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;prisoner&amp;quot;.

A few highlights:

(1) The 400 or so prisoners at Guantanamo are only a tiny proportion of the 14,000 prisoners held by the US in secret prisons around the world. Some of them are held at the base on British soil at Diego Garcia (the US military have admited it even if the official line of both governments is denial).

(2) CSS once highlighted the level of US censorship over what goes on at Guantanamo by writing a letter to Tony Blair in which he reported various discussions he'd had with a client who'd been tortured. This letter, of course, went through the US military censor and every word between 'Dear Prime Minister' and 'Yours sincerely' was blanked out. You can imagine what fun the British press had with that one on their front pages.

(3) One of his clients had been flown to Morocco for torture, and although on a weekly basis (for several weeks) he had his penis slashed with a razor during interrogations, he reckoned the worst thing he had to deal with was the music. The Moroccans played an Eminem track (I forget which one) to him continually, 24x7, for twenty days. However, the upside is that this provided a novel route to a legal challenge, because if Eminem agrees (and they think he will) CSS intends to sue the Moroccan government for royalties for the use of one of his copyrighted recordings something like 1,000 times. I love the thought that right now, all over the American gulag, torturers are frantically downloading MCPS return forms.......

(4) When discussing how difficult British people find it to understand the supine attitude of the American news media to human rights violations (and indeed government lies) he gave the audience an example of how much more conservative America is than Britain. He analysed the voting records (in Parliament and the US Senate) of Margaret Thatcher and Edward Kennedy, and on every issue Maggie's voting record was more left-wing than Teddy's. The whole political map is shifted so far to the right in the US that Europeans find it hard to relate to it.

(5) When appealing Federal death penalty cases in the Supreme Court, under Federal law the question of guilt or innocence of the accused is not a relevant ground for an appeal. So you can have watertight proof of someone's innocence, but under US law that can't be used to prevent their execution. (Wow...the rabbit hole goes that far....)

(6) The iguanas in Guantanamo Bay have more rights than the prisoners. US environmental laws apply on the base, and any harm to an iguana can attract a $10,000 fine. Hitting a prisoner, on the other hand, is classed as &amp;quot;mild non-injurious contact&amp;quot; and attracts no penalty at all.

(7) The motto of the Guantanamo Bay base is &amp;quot;Honour Bound To Defend Freedom&amp;quot;. Leaving aside the resonances with &amp;quot;Arbeit Macht Frei&amp;quot;, the funny thing is that when soldiers salute officers on the base they are obliged to say &amp;quot;Honour Bound, Sir&amp;quot;, and the reply is &amp;quot;To Defend Freedom, Soldier&amp;quot;. CSS at first assumed this was a piss-take for his benefit, until his laughter attracted dirty looks.

(8) Force-feeding procedures at Guantanamo, it was recently proudly announced, have been altered specifically to increase the distress to the prisoners. These are peaceful hunger-strikers, by the way.

(9) Despite Donald Rumsfeld's original claim that everyone in Guantanamo had been picked up on a battlefield in Afghanistan, that is true of hardly any. One of CSS's clients was kidnapped in Gambia, slightly further from Kabul than Edinburgh is. Mostly they were turned in by Pakistanis attracted by the $5000 bounty money on offer. Adjusted for GDP, that would be $250,000 in Scotland. Clive asked us if we'd be prepared to turn in an innocent stranger if we'd get quarter of a million dollars and no inconvenient questions?

And much, much more. His latest book is Bad Men: Guantanamo Bay and the Secret Prisons . Well worth a read, I'd think.

Oh, and there were at least two released (courtesy of Reprieve) US Death Row inmates in the audience.

Reprieve's website is here .

Ruairidh hit sixteen today and requested a trip to see the film version of Mamma Mia! (That's my boy!) It came as no surprise: all the Saunders family have seen the stage version twice, once in London and once in Edinburgh, while some have seen it three times. The film didn't disappoint. No, Piers Brosnan can't sing very well, but Colin Firth's dancing isn't as bad as it's been made out, and he manages his solo numbers very adroitly. Musical arrangements are by Benny and Bjorn, and make use of plenty of the original Abba backing musicians. (As well as of Benny and Bjorn themselves, each of whom has a tiny cameo on the film .) There are some differences from the stage version in the musical numbers: no One Of Us , no Under Attack ; but we get When All Is Said And Done instead, Persephone's unfavourite rhyme and all. The cast throw themselves into the song and dance routines with huge enthusiasm. Meryl Streep sings and dances wonderfully. The scenery is marvellous. And Amanda Seyfried as Sophie is perfection.

I understand that Name of the Game and Knowing Me and Knowing You (uh-huh) were left out because they "didn't advance the story line". Too bad. Those are the the two ABBA songs I rather like (apart from the tune to All is Said and Done and the harmonies in Angel Eyes ). Therefore, even with the lure of Colin F-f-f-f-irth, I don't know if I will be tempted into the cinema.

Well, Meryl Streep does an excellent job on Slipping Through My Fingers . Actually I was slightly surprised to find my self being more impressed by Streep than by Christine Baranski or Julie Walters, good though they are in their rsther more one-dimensional parts. Though I may be being unfair on Baranski, who gives Does Your Mother Know? (her one solo) a good seeing-to: howver, that number suffers in the film from Pepper's character (and infatuation with Tanya) having not been properly set up beforehand, and by my having seen the same phenomenally good Tanya
both times I saw the stage version - and she set the bar very high indeed for DYMK.

I noticed Stephen Fry's The Ode Less Travelled on Amazon, and was taken by the sample quoted of his poetry:

Lesbian Sappho made this form
With two beats to the final line.
Her sex life wasn't quite the norm
And nor is mine .

It put me in mind of the Poetic Forms Personified list.

And how could I have forgotten that it is Fry who gave us the priceless haiku:

Writing a poem
With seventeen syllables
Is very diffi-

But I must confess my bias here. You see, I'm a terza rima:

I'm terza rima , and I talk and smile.
Where others lock their rhymes and thoughts away
I let mine out, and chatter all the while.

I'm rarely on my own - a wasted day
Is any day that's spent without a friend,
With nothing much to do or hear or say.

I like to be with people, and depend
On company for being entertained;
Which seems a good solution, in the end.

Apparently if I weren't terza rima I would be a sonnet:

I am the sonnet , never quickly thrilled;
Not prone to overstated gushing praise
Nor yet to seething rants and anger, filled
With overstretched opinions to rephrase;
But on the other hand, not fond of fools,
And thus, not fond of people, on the whole;
And holding to the sound and useful rules,
Not those that seek unjustified control.
I'm balanced, measured, sensible (at least,
I think I am, and usually I'm right);
And when more ostentatious types have ceased,
I'm still around, and doing, still, alright.
In short, I'm calm and rational and stable -
Or, well, I am, as much as I am able. What Poetry Form Are You?

Capriccio, Cologne Opera, Edinburgh Festival Theatre, 30 August 2007

My final festival review for 2007, unless tomorrow night's Fireworks Concert elicits a post: I shan't be attending, but we have a flat roof which commands a decent view of the Castle Rock, and the concert is broadcast on the radio, so except for ground-hugging cascade-type effects we will get to see most of it. The first couple of years of fireworks concerts we queued up and went along to see it properly in Princes Street Gardens, but then it got too busy and the music became a bit variable. And the cascades are most fun when they set the Castle Rock alight, which they did on our second year.

Anyway.....

Capriccio was the world premiere of a new co-production by Cologne Opera and the Edinburgh Festival, and had attracted a lot of attention. We went because we like Richard Strauss, we like opera, and we hadn't seen it before (or even heard the music).

The general theme of the operatic strand of this year's festival has been the relationship between words and music, and that is very much what Capriccio is about. The opera deals with a group of people (a poet, a composer, a director, and some of their patrons) outside Paris in the 18th century, and considers the question of which is more important, music or words (or, indeed, the production). This is all bound up with a love triangle, where both the poet and the composer are in love with their patron the Countess, who ends up admitting to herself that she can't bring herself to choose between them.

So far, so conventional. Capriccio is not a frequently-produced opera, even in Germany. Sometimes it's done in 19th century costume and style, sometime in modern dress to highlight the fact that when Strauss was writing it, under the watchful eye of the Nazis, Paris was under their occupation. Neither approach is wholly satisfactory nowadays. This new production by Christian von Götz combines the approaches, having the action framed (both in time and space) by Hitler's world, while the core of the action takes place in Rococo Paris. It may sound a bit ary, but actually it works. At the beginning we see the Count providing forged documents for (one assumes) Jewish refugees. At the end, the Countess realises that all her friends have disappeared, and she herself is eventually escorted away to imprisonment. It sounds arty, but it works. The production has many other felicities, not least the Dancer. She appears in Act Two and dances for the company. She is clearly the protegée of one of the characters (the Count, I think) who is very keen on her and intends to advance her career. In a traditional production I would guess she is simply a ballerina. In this one, she starts out as a &amp;quot;ballerina&amp;quot; but gradually sheds items of clothing and is clearly actually more of a stripper. The production gets a lot of comic mileage out of her, partly in the reaction of the Count to her dancing, and partly in her interactions with a pair of singers who are part of the same entertainment. For the record, she was played by Luisa Sancho Escanero: one heck of a dancer.

If the production wins the contest here, the words and music are well suported. Gabriele Fontana was exraordinary as the Countess, whose big final solo is the climax of the opera. Strauss was exceptionally good at writing for women, and that scene is one of those &amp;quot;moments of clarity&amp;quot; like the one the Marschallin has in Act One of Der Rosenkavalier when she sings &amp;quot;Heute oder Morgen&amp;quot;. The Marschallin is recognising that her young lover will eventually give her up in favour of someone his own age, there, the Countess is accepting her inability to choose between her two lovers (she's a widow and realises that she'll probably only get one more shot at romance, only here are two besotted lovers at once: bummer). The music is extraordinarily beautiful in itself, and when one considers that it was both Strauss's last opera and (by common consent) the last true Romantic opera, it carries a lot of emotional freight, as a valediction to the Countess's past, opera's past, Strauss's past and the pre-war world.

I enjoyed the performance unreservedly; Hilary thought the final scene was too long, which still leaves me gobsmacked, as though she'd wanted to cut bits of Wotan's Farewell in Die Walküre . (Don't worry, reader, she isn't that far gone yet.) Still, the critics were divided to an extraordinary extent. Here , first of all is the Daily Telegraph's critic, who clearly went to the same opera we did. Then the Edinburgh Evening News , and The Independent , both again enthusiastic. Then we move to the less convinced end of the spectrum, with the Financial Times and The Scotsman (whose critic manages entirely to miss the humour of the Dancer's performance). Finally we have The Guardian , the only critic apart from the FT not to be wowed by Gabriele Fontana's performance, and who could find nothing else good to say about the evening. I suspect he was so busy jotting down details of the framing Nazi-era staging (I didn't spot a cyanide capsule anywhere, and neither Hilary nor I considered the COuntess obsessed by her pearls in any way) that he neglected to listen to any of the actual opera.

So our lesson today, children, is to ignore critics. For every one who agrees with your (good or bad) assessment there will be a hack whose unrecognisable impressions suggest a viewing via YouTube (with the sound off)at best. Trust your own instincts. Maybe all your friends think something you hated is wonderful? Screw them. (Nobody will convince me now that watching Shakespeare In Love wasn't a tragic loss of what felt like ten hours of my life, or that Schubert's Ninth Symphony has any redeeming qualities whatsoever.) Trust your own judgement, and it will lead you to wonderful things (usually).

Anyway, yes, Capriccio : a fitting climax to the 2007 festival, and a magical performance all round. (All the people I know who saw it agree.)

Saturday 19 July - Lyceum Youth Theatre - Summer On Stage 2008 - The Red Shoes Re-Heeled

Another year, another LYT drama summer school for our stage-struck son. This year he was taking part in The Red Shoes re-Heeled , an updating of Hans Christian Andersen's classic story by Emma Rosoman. Natalie Ibu directed, just before taking up a year's residency at the Royal Court. The kids acted brilliantly: Ruairidh, as Quentin, had the biggest male role (along with the shoemaker) and plenty of scope for comedic moments. The biggest part, though, is Karen, whose lines are distributed among four actresses (five if you count Old Karen). Karen the orphan trying to find her identity and thinking she can do it via the medium of "cool stuff" - possessions, in her case the eponymous footwear. It works up to a point: everyone thinks the shoes are marvellous, but their effect on Karen's personality is less healthy (and damages her attempt to fit in). The shoes bind themselves magically to her feet so they are in control. However, in this version Old Karen, who no longer cares about the downside risk, removes the shoes from her younger self, giving rise to an ambiguous and mostly unresolved ending. But then life's like that.

There's a new Thomas Truax video on YouTube for Why Dogs Howl At The Moon . Definitely a contender for Best Dog In A Music Video 2007.

And of course there are other equally weird TT videos here and here . There are various bits of live footage of variable quality out there, but this and this are pretty good and give a vague idea of the live Thomas Truax experience. I'm sorry that I missed him in Edinburgh last week.

Browsing around last.fm and Youtube for videos of blasts from my musical past, I found this . While the video component is only swirls it isn't inappropriate to its music, and the music itself is the opening track of the album I posted about here .

One of the things I was looking for was this video of Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention doing Cosmik Debris . I saw it on TV in a tribute to Frank just after his death, and thought then that his solo was one of the best I'd ever heard. FZ didn't often play in what I'd call the Eric Clapton blues style, but here he demonstrates just how well he could do it. If you want guitar histrionics, go somewhere else. (Frank could do them ,of course,when he wanted to.)

And finally, I couldn't find a video of FZ doing My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama as I'd hoped, but here is a marvellously comic video with his son Dweezil covering it. How many people could do such a good version? And how many sons get such great material from their fathers in the first place?

Having seen them both live on top form (FZ on the Uncle Meat tour and EC with Delaney & Bonnie) I wouldn't be unkind about either of them, though my personal favourite would always be Zappa, as much for his total musicianship as for any technical superiority or greater versatility. (And my personal favourite British electric guitarist remains Richard Thompson for the same reason.)

Scottish Opera Wednesday 25th June - A Night at The Chinese Opera
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<POST>
<POSTER> sted by Rob @ </POSTER>

To the Edinburgh Playhouse for a night at the Judith Weir opera (well, one of them). I'd seen what I think is her only other full opera (Blond Eckbert) on television many years ago: you have to admire an opera whose plot hinges on the name of a dog*.

ANATCO, like Eckbert, has humorous moments, rather more of them in fact. The story is a Hamlet-ish one of a boy, Chao Lin, brought up ignorant of his parentage by the killer of his real father. In this case it's his own memory which is jogged by a "play within a play", leading him to attempt the killing of the usurper, but he fails and is executed. The play within a play (actually the Chinese opera of the title) ends with the son successfully avenging his father's death, though its performance is interrupted in such a way that the ending isn't delivered until after the real protagonist has been killed. It reminded me of the Harold Pinter film adaptation of John Fowles's "The French Lieutenant's Woman", whose twin endings are rendered on screen by a similar dramatic device.

Despite being sung in English the production (by Lee Blakely) made use of surtitles. Quite apart from improving comprehension wherever the diction was poor (not often) these provided some tremendous comic moments in the play-within-a-play. There is a time when an old man is telling the "Chinese opera's" hero (The Orphan Of Chao) about his father, and is doing so in a very fast and difficult-to-grasp way. The boy keeps looking up at the surtitles which at first are keeping up, then begin to degenerate to "something about a chase", "something about a horse", before hitting on "I'm not paid enough for this". Finally the old man comes to an end and looks expectantly at the boy, who whirls round desperately to look at the surtitles which promptly change to "You are SO on your own! You should have been listening."

Judith Weir's music is very singable (no excessive demands or wildly leaping intervals) but not, I suspect, easy to learn, as her melodies while satisfying at the time don't stay with one for long (cue Chinese food analogy here). One could say the same of Britten, whose music is wonderful but difficult to remember in any detail (at least, I challenge anyone not a professional-level singer to commit more than a dozen bars or so of Peter Grimes's big aria "Now the Great Bear and the Pleiades" to memory). Damian Thantrey as the adult Chao Lin probably had the most demanding task that way, and I thought he brought it off very well, as did the troupe of actors. I have heard criticism of the opera itself in that it lacked real emotion: specifically that Chao Lin's execution was rather matter-of-fact. That's fair comment, but I suspect it was deliberate. Perhaps Judith Weir wanted to make a point about Chinese fatalism, or the cheapness of individual life in China both in Genghis Khan's time and more recently; perhaps she simply wanted to focus on the conclusion of the inner "Chinese opera" to make some kind of Man-Who-Shot-Liberty-Valance point about the relative longevity of true stories and legends. Although her music is not for the most part overtly emotional stuff, here we are talking about the downplaying of a major event in the text, so I'm pretty sure it will have been intentional. Anyhow, Hilary and I both enjoyed it.

*Strohmian, if you were wondering. Is that not a cool name for a dog?

Of course, when talking of New York wingnuts we have to remember &amp;quot;presidential hopeful&amp;quot; (who is he trying to kid?) Rudy Giuliani . Not only has he been an outspoken opponent of Ahmadinejad's visit to Ground Zero (because we all know, Iran carried out the September 11th attacks, right?) but he has a history of this kind of intemperate...what's the phrase? oh yes, &amp;quot;disgracing the United States of America&amp;quot; .

A grain or two of truth among the grass

Tim (Kalyr) alerted me to a recent Guardian article where people were asked to nominate their favourite flop (commercial or critical) follow-up albums. A number of people nominated Pulp's This Is Hardcore which seems very reasonable. There was also this perceptive response from 'carefree':

"Pulp - This is Hardcore, although probably already mentioned above its a cut above Different Class"

- actually, if you're mentioning Different Class, I'd argue the reverse of the original proposition - Pulp's great tragedy was that they became massive one album *after* their masterpiece - His'n'Hers is their best album by a country mile, and they followed it up with some crowd-pleasing hit songs and bloody Sadie Frost larking around in a supermarket - I ask you!

I once read a genius comment along the lines of "Jarvis Cocker's entire career is founded on the fact he knows he will never write a better song than 'Babies'" - very cruel, but a grain of truth in there. 'Don't Let Him Waste Your Time' comes pretty close to Babies though...

I have always had a soft spot for Glory Days on This Is Hardcore , which contains my favourite Cocker couplet:

Well I used to do the I Ching, but then I had to feed the meter;
Now I can't see into the future, but at least I can use the heater.

(Note for the perplexed: the most common way of casting I Ching hexagrams involves tossing three coins.)

Someone else suggested Pink Floyd's A Saucerful of Secrets , to which I would add both Animals and Obscured By Clouds . Relayer by Yes lay undeservedly in the shadow of its massive predecessor Tales From Topographic Oceans, and I always seem to have liked Kevin Ayers's The Confessions of Doctor Dream more than most people I know. Then there's Richard & Linda Thompson's Sunnyvista , sandwiched between Pour Down Like Silver and Shoot Out The Lights and unjustly overlooked as a result. Possibly the best example, though, is the Abba album that hardly anyone remembers (and no, I don't mean Abba Live , though that has its moments too): The Visitors . If anything, the strains in the band added to the strange left-field quality of the album which evidently put off a lot of people expecting another Super Trouper . It only has one real clunker ( Two For The Price Of One ) and several bona fide masterpieces (the title track, When All Is Said And Done , One Of Us , Slipping Through My Fingers - the last two having received a new lease of life via the musical Mamma Mia! )

I detect a hint of irony there... Actually viewing Abba as pop music's answer to Gustav Mahler rather than Tom Lehrer is closer to the truth, at least in the sense that the music of both is caught in this perpetual balancing act between the profound and the banal. And in the same way that Mahler was fully aware of everything he was writing and the effect it would have, I don't believe that Abba - certainly by the end of their career - were releasing anything whose effect on the listener was unintended. Not even Two For The Price Of One , however much I might wish it otherwise.

Clearly, I should have put my smiley in there! I didn't intend to be ironic or sarcastic; I thought your comment about Lehrer was very clever, because I would have indeed giggled helplessly in that context. As for Mahler, alas, he only ever made me groggy, so I guess I have neither Alma Schindler's brains nor stamina (as she, in Tom's immortal words: "bagged Gustaf and Walter and Franz").

Total number of books owned

I'm not sure, but something like 2,000 - 2,500.

Last book bought

The Last Family In England by Matt Haig, which is basically Shakespeare's Henry IV Part 1 re-imagined with a cast of dogs.

Last book read

Last one completed: The Confusion by Neal Stephenson, second part of a superb trilogy of 18th-century historical novels by a writer previously known only for his science fiction.

Currently reading: Canal Dreams , by Iain Banks, which he considers his least satisfactory book mainly because he chose as his protagonist a Japanese female professional cellist, a character triply distant from his own experiences.

Five books that mean a lot to you

Alan Watts: The Book On The Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are

George Antheil: Bad Boy Of Music

Dorothy Dunnett: King Hereafter

Iain Banks: The Crow Road

Douglas Hofstadter: Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid

Floating just beyond the cut-off point is a raft of books including Sense and Sensibility (Austen), Island (Huxley), The Four Winds Of Love quartet (Compton Mackenzie), Red For Danger (LTC Rolt), Snow Crash (Neal Stephenson), the Falco series (Lindsey Davis) and the Aurelio Zen books by Michael Dibden.

And five more sufferers to tag: Clare , Lisa , Cloud , Phil and Joe , then.

Well, Cotton &amp;amp; Wilkinson's Advanced Inorganic Chemistry has about 800, and I only counted it once. And my one-volume Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is over 1000.

And my score of Thomas Tallis's Spem In Alium is nearly A2 in size (that's roughly 4 times college notepad size for an American) though only around 25 pages thick.

A wonderful poem from 1988, by a Burmese comedian currently then imprisoned by the authorities and now locked up again.

However, as I read it, I can't help thinking that if Zargana had been, say, an Iraqi Muslim instead of a Burmese Buddhist, the Guardian would have been inundated with protests that it was glorifying suicide bombing.

I thought this was a genuinely funny take on Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's visit to New York.

The site has a number of equally droll pieces, like this and this .

And yeah, I know they're conservatives. But some of them can be deliberately funny as well as hopping-around-having-shot-foot-off funny.

Tonight my wife and daughter went to see Shakespeare's The Winter's tall at Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum Theatre. Ruairidh and I went to see it earlier in the week. The production is directed by Mark Thomson, and has attracted a certian amount of comment for being weird: which, frankly, it doesn't deserve. It's done in modern dress, and on a plain white set furnished with ingenious openings for entrances, exits, attempts at both, and flashes of off-stage action (rather as though it had been designed by Ann Summers, though it wasn't). The controversy, I suspect, centres on the way in which the Act 4 appearance of &amp;quot;Time, as Chorus&amp;quot; has been staged. I can see that the portrayal of an allegorical figure as an entr'acte in an otherwise earthbound drama is always going to be troublesome; and that simply using a voice-over has probably been done so sften there's some kind of ban on it. So how do you personify &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; in the 21st century? Perhaps an electric wheelchair suspended in mid-air, surrounded by clouds of dry ice and occupied by someone speaking in a synthesized voice is as good as we'll get, though my daughter in particular thought the concept didn't work. I must agree with her that as Time's dramatic purpose is to imnpart information, it would have helped if his electronic voice had been more readily understood: the real Stephen Hawking is much easier to follow than this one was. That aside, I had no complaints with the production, and thought the acting in general very good. The best-known player was Una McLean as Paulina (doubling as Dorcas - all the Sicilans doubled as Bohemians). I always like to see actors better known for panto and comedy doing straight theatrical work, and Una did not disappoint. Liam Brennan as Leontes handled his fairly swift descent into insane jealousy quite believably, while Selina Boyack was a dignified Hermione who managed an impressive immobility for the statue scene (which must be a nightmare). Pride of place among the actors, though, must go to Alan Francis as Autolycus, not just because he doubled as the very unfunny Antigonus (whose final exit has the famous stage direction of the post title) but because he was compulsively watchable: when he was on stage, that was what you were looking at. I susoect that is as much a gift as a talent, but either way I salute him for it.

Alabama 3 - Glasgow Carling Academy 22 September 2007

The evening got off to a poor beginning when I turned up at the ABC in Sauchiehall Street, as per my ticket and all the publicity, to find the gig had been relocated to the Carling Academy, a couple of miles away across the river (in the Gorbals, in fact). Fortunately I had driven to Glasgow and was parked nearby, so managed to get to the Carling in plenty of time. I even caught the support. They were unexciting if pleasant, but for a band with a lot of rap-type lyrics their singer's poor diction was a drawback. When he first introduced the band I though they were called &amp;quot;Verruca Boots&amp;quot;, which would have been cooler than their real name &amp;quot;Republic of Loose&amp;quot;. The singer kept moaning at the audience that they weren't dancing or getting excited. That this owed more to him than to their stolidity was shown the instant the Alabama 3 came on and set the place alight.

I was interested to see the Alabama 3 , having heard them highly praised by Clare . &amp;quot;Acid house, blues, country and gospel&amp;quot; just about captures their style, while omitting to mention that both their front men (Rob Spragg and Jake Black) look like a pair of Stars In Their Eyes competitors who have decided that tonight, Matthew, they're going to be Duke from the Doonesbury comic strip:

I'd got a couple of their CDs but didn't therefore assume I'd know too much of their live set. In the event, they did a lot of songs from both La Peste and Exile On Coldharbour Lane . We had Too Sick To Pray , U Don't Dance 2 Techno , Woke Up This Morning , The Thrills Have Gone , 2129 , Hypo Full Of Love and (to my huge delight) Mao Tse-Tung Said . Hard to say which one fired up the audience the most, though the sight of many hundred Glaswegian hands punching into the air in clenched-fist salutes during Mao Tse-Tung Said (&amp;quot;Mao Tse-Tung said change must come / Change must come through the barrel of a gun / Not through talkin' and not through waitin' / And sittin' around just contemplatin' / The facts, 'cos we know what they are / So let Mao Tse-Tung be your guiding star / Pick up a gun and learn how to fight / All through the day and all through the night / Until the day when the last fight's on / I want you to listen, son / Because Mao Tse-Tung said change must come / Change must come through the barrel of a gun&amp;quot;) was the most memorable of a memorable evening. More please.

Edinburgh Players Opera Group: Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, 30 September 2007

Not a review exactly, as I was viewing this one from inside the orchestra. Regulars here will know the idea: every year since 2001 a bunch of enthusiasts, abetted by some splendid professional soloists, put on a informal concert performance of one of Wagner's music dramas. The whole business is crammed into a long weekend, with rehearsals generally starting early on Friday afternoon and going on through Saturday, and with the public appearing on Sunday. We don't charge admission but have a collection.

2007 marks the end of an era in one sense, in that while Wagner wrote several earlier operas he wrote only seven &amp;quot;music dramas&amp;quot;, and now EPOG has done them all. (In order: Das Rheingold, Die Walküre, Siegfried, Götterdämmerung, Tristan und Isolde, Parsifal, Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg .) Several individuals have been involved in them all, including me. (Hilary had to miss Parsifal because her father might have been about to die, and would normally have had nothing to do this year - Meistersinger is the only one without a bass clarinet - except that the second clarinet called in sick on the day so she rushed in to sight-read acts 2 and 3.)

Our usual soprano (Brünnhilde, Isolde, Kundry) is Elaine McKrill, who unfortunately was committed to a series of performances in Germany this year, though I'm sure she'll be back. (We're planning to do the Ring again at the very least, so in 2009 she could be back Hojotoho -ing. Maybe she'd like to be a Rhinemaiden next year?) Eva was however very well sung by Sara Estill, who was new to me. Our Parsifal and Tristan from previous years, Jonathan Finney, sang Walther quite magnificently, while Gerard Delrez was an astonishing Sachs (astonishingly enthusiastic - he made up for our shortage of percussionists by playing the triangle for the guild choruses in Act 3 without even being asked - and astonishing that we could afford to hire someone that good!) Wonderful singing all round, but final special mention must go to Andrew Mayor whose voice as Beckmesser made you feel he nmight have won the contest if only he'd had longer to learn Morgenlich leuchtend .

All this was held together by Mike Thorne our conductor, whose day job is Vice-Chancellor of the University of East London. An amateur in the very best sense of the word, Mike used to conduct a wide variety of (frequently somewhat unusual) repertoire when he was based in Edinburgh. These days we only see him for Wagner, but his preparation is exemplary. Over seven years of doing the music dramas, with amateur players and chorus and a mix of professional and semi-pro singers, we have had precisely one occasion when a stop and restart was required ( Götterdämmerung , Act 2, Scene 3, the Chorus of the Gibichung Vassals, if you want to know: simply a vast ensemble to attempt to hold together through some rather tricky corners.)

From a player's perspective, doing Meistersinger is quite a different experience from the other music dramas. There's less of the dense swirling stuff that blackens page after page of Walküre, but the key changes still come faster than you'd like (and the famous quintet is in six flats!). More alarmingly, it's the only music drama where you can have a line of music with ten notes in it and need full concentration to work out where every one is supposed to go. In part that's because there's a lot of light-textured music accompanying very free and flexible singing; in part it's just down to Wagner liking to play around with being on the beat and off the beat. In the end we hit most of them, though a few of the very fluid bits of (especially Beckmesser's) singing had somewhat untidy accompaniment. But.....we survived, we produced the goods (audience members I spoke to afterwards had thoroughly enjoyed it) and we all enjoyed it, tiring though it was.

Thanks to our leader Philip Taylor, not so much for leading as for conceiving and administering the whole enterprise. A splendid achivement.

EPOG sold commemorative mugs when we completed the Ring. I feel that in the same way as one can buy commercially-made &amp;quot;I survived Parsifal&amp;quot; t-shirts (which mere audience members should be banned from defiling) we should have had &amp;quot;I survived all Wagner's music dramas&amp;quot; ones made. Ah well.

Though if I were to have a Wagnerian t-shirt made specially, I'd really like to get a deisgn with four Wagner Tubas , coloured red, yellow, green and blue and topped with respectively an attached circle, an spiral, a spike and a sort of inverted coat-hanger. (You're ahead of me, aren't you?) Underneath, or better still on the back, would be text reading: Wagnertubbies say &amp;quot;Hojoto-ho!&amp;quot;

Sorry.

Until next September then, in E flat, at the bottom of the Rhine.

This really is 9/11, not 11/9. And tragic though 11/9 was, it was just a little local inconvenience when set beside what is commemorated internationally on 9/11 .

On 9th November 1938, on what would become known as Kristallnacht , the Nazis organised the destruction and looting of Jewish-owned businesses throughout Germany (as well as in Nazi-controlled Austria). Jews were murdered or carted off to camps. Synagogues were burned. We all know the end of the story which began in earnest 69 years ago tonight..

American-style &amp;quot;academic freedom&amp;quot; comes to Oxford , courtesy of London Zionist Paul Ussiskin. How proud he must be. But what was the Oxford Union thinking of, caving in to him?

Update: why am I unsurprised that the dead hand (and moribund intellect, but sadly all too healthy remainder) of Alan Dershowitz turns out to have been behind this disgrace ?

Further update: no need to say why I'm unsurprised that Harry's Place (washes out mouth) is adding to the lies circulating.

Meanwhile here we have Daniel Pipes (a doughty battler against academic freedom wherever it rears its head in the USA) indefatigably supporting a terrorist organisation banned by the US State Department. Because, you see, it only slaughters Muslims. Here he is again , cheering on the murder of Muslims by Iraqi insurgents and expressing satisfaction that the civil war in Iraq will slow down the spread of democracy in the Middle East, because that would be terrible (having elections might legitimise governments with Muslims in them). So: terrorism good, democracy bad. Murder good, elections bad. Iraqi insurgents good, US government bad. That this ape is organising fascist rallies in the USA right now instead of being waterboarded in Guantanamo says more about the pervasiveness of the &amp;quot;Israel Lobby&amp;quot; than anything Mearsheimer and Walt could come up with.

By way of explanation for non-UK readers: last Saturday Scotland narrowly failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 football championship despite being in a group with both Italy (who eventually overcame them) and France (whom they had beaten both home and away). England, OTOH, had only to draw with Croatia on Wednesday in order to qualify. Cue much sympathetic wagging of heads from our Southern neighbours.

I wonder if you can guess from this Daily Mash spoof how that match went?

Meanwhile in other football news, Mario Gomez of Stuttgart seems to have found fame in an unusual way. to wit by being the first player to score a goal with his penis . What you might call a flying tackle.

From the popular to the downright obscure. I was chatting with Edinburgh Symphony Orchestra's conductor Gerry Doherty last week about programme suggestions for 2008-9, and mentioned that I'd been listening on the radio to James McMillan's Stomp (with Fate and Elvira) . I reckoned it sounded fun and maybe we should try it some time (we did his Confession of Isobel Gowdie a couple of years back). Gerry said he'd done a piece called Underground Music with the RSNO, written by &amp;quot;some Russian-born Canadian guy&amp;quot;. Like the McMillan, it was full of clever references to other pieces and was great fun. A bit of Googling led me to Nikolai Korndorf , whose 1996 fourth symphony is Underground Music and whose music has been championed by the RSNO's former conductor Alexander Lazarev. Wondering what the guy's music was actually like, I came upon this site where you can stream his 1998 The Smile Of Maud Lewis (about 14 minutes). I commend it to you: it may be obscure, but it's rather good. It took me a couple of minutes to get into it: it starts with a Michael Nyman-like irritatingly repetitive motif (though actually if you check out the extracts from the score on the same site the &amp;quot;repetitions&amp;quot; keep changing in both the sequence of notes and the articulation - one of those &amp;quot;drop your concentration and die&amp;quot; pieces) but before long it reveals itself as actually rather tuneful. It would be fun to do, despite its challenges, if I could persuade the rest of the committee. And, of course, if it doesn't cost our entire music hire budget to obtain (modern pieces can be obscenely expensive, but then composers have to eat). Anyway, have a listen: if you like minimalism at all, you'll enjoy it. And if you don't, maybe this piece will change your mind. Who knows? I'll tell you something, though: I shall be keeping an eye (and two ears) out for (the sadly now deceased) Mr Korndorf''s work.

First of all, apologies for not posting for a few days. Work has been particularly hectic (I was in much of the weekend helping to recover from a major system problem) plus I've been writing an essay on various issues to do with aid to Africa for HIV/AIDS treatment. Busy busy busy.

Anyway, here I am, and like the character in the Zappa song , &amp;quot;I figure the odds be fifty-fifty I might just have something to say&amp;quot;.

Let's start with something silly. I started following one of those chains of hyperlinks the other day, beginning with an article on diamonds and ending up via a circuitous route at the Wikipedia entry for Magnesium Diboride. As you do. I clicked on a link there which took me to this description of a novel MRI scanner. I especially liked the part where they tell us that &amp;quot;The first MR‐Open system is an open magnet structure built around an iron joke&amp;quot;.

Presumably this one .

It takes a lot to get me linking to the Daily Mail , but I couldn't let this pass without comment. Not - for once - on the Mail's reporting, but on the content. Even if the Mail 's reporter has exaggerated every single fact by 100%, it's still shocking, to me at least, that such a dreadful crime can earn such a derisory punishment.

I keep wondering how Read gets on with his work colleagues. Quite apart from if they know what he's done - is he scary to work with, or one of those guys who save it all up for when they get home?

My quartet and orchestra partner Emma was in Glasgow tonight to see Celtic play Benfica. One can only hope that she has overcome her irritation at the Fratellis' &amp;quot;Chelsea Dagger&amp;quot;, which is played every time Celtic hit the back of the net. Celtic 1 - Benfica 0 so she should be happy with the scoreline if not the soundtrack.

Just imagine if she'd been at Anfield and Liverpool used the Fratellis.... (Liverpool 8 - Besiktas 0). And for all the American nuts who think we're all raging anti-Semites on this side of the Atlantic, you may just find that he most popular man in Liverpool tonight is an Israeli Jew .

If you watched Sunday's South Bank Show on ITV you won't need reminding that this week is also the fortieth anniversary of the publication of Britain's best-selling, and arguably most influential, anthology of poetry: The Mersey Sound (aka Penguin Modern Poets 10) by Adrian Henri, Roger McGough and Brian Patten. Sure, the beats were great, but these guys were our domestic product, and they rocked. Hilary and I managed to see themn in the Festival Fringe a few years ago (oh God, I just checked and it must be 22 years ago in fact) when they were promoting the follow-up anthology New Volume , a signed copy of which now graces our bookshelf.

Here in commemoration are my favourites from the first anthology by Henri , McGough and last but probably best-loved, Patten .

I may have unwittingly traduced Melanie Phillips in my recent post . I'd forgotten that, like Ann Coulter, she is a creationist and a global warming sceptic, rounding off her own anti-science crusade by constantly telling lies about the MMR vaccine. Not even Coulter leaves a trail of unvaccinated, deformed and sterile children in her wake: at least, not so far as I know.

Also, I hadn't then read this gem . The bit I like best is when she lays into Geoffrey Wheatcroft, who had said:

For years, the Tory party and the Tory press have been infiltrated by our own neoconservatives, more determined even than Blair to serve the national interest of another country. Under William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard - egged on by Charles Moore, Matthew d’Ancona and Michael Gove - the Tories came close to being what the socialist leader Leon Blum called the French Communists, ‘a foreign nationalist party’.

Her response?

Eh? What is this other country whose ‘national interest’ the neo-cons supposedly serve? In the fevered imagination of the bigots who attack them, this is supposed to be Israel.

Oh, of course, Mel, it's all about Israel. Everything is about Israel. Any normal reader would realise at once that it was America that was being referred to, but Mel can't see that. Then again, she thinks the point of the following passage is to criticise America's links with Israel:

As Alan Cowell, the shrewd London correspondent of the New York Times, wrote last month, ‘If the Lebanon conflict said anything about what some Britons like to call their special relationship with America, it seemed to be this: in this Middle East war, the only special relationship bound the United States to Israel, not Britain’.

In fact, as you will have worked out for yourself, not being crazy, Alan Cowell was criticising Tony Blair's insistence, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that his embarrassing fawning over the Bush gang in some way gave him a huge amount of influence with the US administration. In fact, of course, Bush et al ignored him completely other than to give him orders.

Regarding her ignorant tilting at William Dalrymple, I'm not sure which of these statements is the most priceless:

1. &amp;quot;As for Islamic terrorism, Saddam was its godfather and patron.&amp;quot;

Funny, because Saddam was a secularist who was often criticised by Iraq's mullahs for making their lives difficult. Perhaps she's thinking of the war he launched (with British and American backing) against the hardline Islamic regime in Iran. And the fact that al-Qaeda had no presence in Iraq until after the US invasion. Some godfather. Some patron.

2. &amp;quot;No-one has suggested Saddam was involved with 9/11&amp;quot;

Well, except the Bush Administration, which is why their response to 9/11 was to invade Iraq.

3. &amp;quot;He certainly had connections with al Qaeda&amp;quot;

Does hating each other's guts count as a connection?

4. &amp;quot;Islamic and Arab violence against the Jews was prompted by the entirely peaceful and lawful return of the Jews to their own ancestral home at the beginning of the 20th century.&amp;quot;

The Jews hadn't been given an &amp;quot;ancestral home&amp;quot; until the UN established Israel in 1948. Up until then, the &amp;quot;peaceful returners&amp;quot; were stealing other people's land without even the fig-leaf of international respectability that the UN gave them. And these peaceful lambs were busily bombing civilians long before the Palestinians decided to emulate them.

Coincidentally, I recently came across a old comment by Judith-the-10%-Holocaust-denier Weiss , in which she describes Brit Tzedek v'Shalom's &amp;quot;Bring The Settlers Home&amp;quot; campaign as actually a &amp;quot;campaign to uproot the settlers from the heart of the historical Jewish homeland for the purpose of negotiating peace.&amp;quot; While we all know by now that Weiss has no interest either in a negotiated peace or in the return of Israel to compliance with international law by dismantling its illegal settlements, it's revealing that she considers the &amp;quot;roots&amp;quot; of Israel's social misfits (each and every one fully aware that they had no right to build in someone else's country) to be deeper than those of the Arabs they ethnically cleansed, most of whose families had lived there since before Israel was invented. And she clearly shares with Mad Mel a belief in the myth of the &amp;quot;historic Jewish homeland&amp;quot; extending way beyond Israel (but where does it stop? Kashmir?) Isn't it funny how these people are keen to defend Israel's borders, but not to abide by them? Fanatical about the right of Israel to exist, provided that the Israelis don't have to live in it.

Weiss is of course an American, but I guess in Mel P we do have a domestic doozie pretty much as loathsome as Ann Coulter. Fortunately I doubt whether one Briton in ten thousand has ever heard of her, or ever will, which just shows that there are still things we can be proud of as a nation.

&amp;quot;Entirely peaceful and lawful&amp;quot;!

I remember our French teacher telling us about the perils of syllogistic reasoning - essentially, it's easy to prove that pigs have wings, if you start from the premise that pigs can fly. If Phillips genuinely starts from the premise that the settlement of Zionists in Mandatory Palestine was pretty much like the settlement of Polish plumbers in Britain, that would explain a lot about the conclusions she draws.

This could be interesting, especially as Edinburgh is one of the two places being considered for it. Edinburgh University already has the Arthur Koestler Chair of Parapsychology, so we're used to being laughed at. And in just the same way that the Koestler chair isn't in my opinion a matter for laughter (it's about investigation, not belief) I'm sure Donovan's institution will be interesting. While I have little doubt the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is a businessman who has found a great way to get rich (an impression confirmed when I attended one of his road-shows as a student) , I don't have a problem with the benefits of meditation per se .

Though I have my doubts about yogic bouncing flying ....

I admit I had to Google it (I hadn't heard the anecdote, surprisingly). Heh heh.

However, twat or no, the Maharishi was part of the whole 1960s Zeitgeist, so I think it wouldn't have been just musical history that would have changed if the Beatles (or part thereof) had publicly disavowed him. To put the Maharishi in perspective, remember that when I first went to university in 1973 the guru du jour was the Guru Maharaj Ji (&amp;quot;15-year-old Perfect Master&amp;quot;), whose pictures - and followers - were everywhere. I endeared myself to one of my college neighbours by pissing off some of his more earnestly spiritual friends: on my door I had stuck a Robertson's golliwog and the label &amp;quot;Guru Marmalishi Golli: 18-yr-old Perfect Master&amp;quot;. That still rather pleases me.

If you remember GMJ at all it's probably only because I nudged your memory. Whereas the Maharishi.... I don't mean to imply that he was any less more or less phoney than GMJ, merely that he found a place in history that GMJ didn't.

I came upon this rather queasy-making post which I'd happily forgotten when searching for something else. Really, I shouldn't be surprised: this is the woman whose proud boast is that she disrupted an interview with George Galloway with her screaming, and whose record as an apologist for terror (read the comments) and nuclear first strikes speaks for itself.

But leaving aside Weiss's free-speech-for-me-not-for-you attitude, don't you wish these armchair Zionists were half as brave at standing up to real terrorists with guns - or unregulated nuclear weapons -as they are at fearlessly defending Israel against dead American 23-year-old girls and their grieving parents?

Fan Club 3 - Mahler's Symphony No 2 &quot;Resurrection&quot;
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<POST>
<POSTER> sted by Rob @ </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> 2007-11-22T01:10:00 </POSTDATE>
And I just couldn't do a video roundup of classics without my all-time favourite symphony being conducted by that Abbado chap again with the Berlin PO. Mahler's Symphony No 2 is from the end of the 19th century, which is why I didn't put it in my 20th century post.

The piece is in five movements. The third gives you a good flavour of Mahler. Note the percussionist whacking the bass drum case with a bundle of birch twigs, which is a uniquely Mahlerian sound.

Third movement

The finale can be relied on to reduce me to tears. That was the case even before the one time I actually played it in an orchestra, which was six months after my father had died and a year after my mother. My father had just started getting interested in classical music, and would surley have been knocked out by the last movement at least. When one is playing, tears are an unaffordable luxury, though I'm sure I sniffled. This is music, after all, representing the last trump and the opening of graves. Every time I go to a performance I half expect to see dead people coming through the walls. Most of you will just have to imagine what it's like being part of a performance: hearing those incredible sounds and knowing that part of them is you. One of my lifetime high points.

Anyway. Turn it up to 11. Perfectly suitable for work if your colleagues don't mind being pinned to the wall by a tsunami of sound from a very large orchestra indeed (plus choir). The last few minutes always seem to me to fit perfectly the metaphor of an enormous craft coming in to land: the music picks up the beacon of D major about three minutes from home at &amp;quot;Sterben werd ich um zu leben&amp;quot;, locks onto it in a more determined way than any other music I know, and comes home.

Finale Part 1
Finale Part 2
Finale Part 3
Finale Part 4

And just because I can, here's Simon Rattle with the CBSO giving the finale his own inimitable treatment. One of the slowest versions of the very end I've ever heard, but blimey.... (There's a rather nasty dislocation in part 2 near the beginning, just where the huge crescendo in the brass is starting. There may be others I've missed. Still worth hearing to compare with the Abbado though.)

Part 2
Part 3
Part 4

I'd never actually read any Ann Coulter before encountering this post : in Britain we remain blissfully free not only of her but of anyone quite so loathsome. I mean, we have Michael Gove and Melanie Phillips , and that's bad enough: but they appear models of sweet reasonableness and toleration alongside Ms Coulter. To their paranoia and hatred she adds a uniquely Christian - and uniquely right-wing American Christian - hatred of anything non-Christian (and non-Jewish: for some reason she excludes Jews from her ranting).

It's worth persevering with Coulter's rubbish. She considers it &amp;quot;manifestly obvious&amp;quot; that a Muslim congressman should have to take an oath on the Bible rathe than the Koran,and demands that he go on record to state whether he believes the Holocaust happened (while requiring such a statement from no other Represntatives). Opposition to the teaching of &amp;quot;intelligent design&amp;quot; is a &amp;quot;faddish liberal cause&amp;quot;. There is apparently a &amp;quot;worldwide terorist movement dedicated to killing Jews&amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;singular threat to Jews at the moment is the complete annilihilation of Israel&amp;quot; (as though there had been a single day since its foundation when that was likely).

Or take this post , cheerleading for David Horowitz's fascist rallies. In it we learn that &amp;quot;Liberals believe in burning the American flag, urinating on crucifixes and passing out birth control pills to 11-year-olds without telling their parents.&amp;quot; (Well that would liven up their party conferences.) Liberals also supposedly support &amp;quot;Islamo-fascism&amp;quot;, which supposedly is something that exists. Oh, and it's OK to bully Muslim kids, especially if they're called Osama, and bad to provide any facilitoes for them to pray.

It must be weird living in the USA and having this kind of drivel beaming into your home every single day by the supposedly liberally-biased &amp;quot;mainstream media&amp;quot;. A kind of relentless dripping tap, like the voices in the heads of the ants in T.H.White's The Sword In The Stone.

Just be thankful for the US Constitution, guys: it's all that stands between you and the thousand-year rule of Coulter, Horowitz, Limbaugh and the rest. (Not to mention Glenn Beck , who turned the Californian fires into an anti-Democrat punchline, to his shame.)

Regulars will recall my earlier posts here here and here concerning Rudy Giuliani. He's recently been on my mind as various of the Kesher Talk contributors seem to think we could do with a Rudy over here. (The general tenor of the post cited is anti-British - essentially, we're decadent girly-men rather than tough have-a-go heroes like the Guardian Angels * - though you might have guessed that if they're wishing a Giuliani on us.)

Anyway, with impeccable timing Ted Rall (who explained what a dud RG was as New York's mayor) has come out with this cartoon. Enjoy.

I thought this was an interesting post, especially this bit:

It has been my experience that if soldiers at a checkpoint see white or Jewish-looking people in the front seat of a car, they will not stop the car and check the passenger's IDs to verify that they have the correct ID to enter Israel. This has happened to me countless times. If anyone who looks Palestinian is sitting in the front seat, they are automatically stopped, even if they are Jewish but have dark skin.

Settler cars zoom through those checkpoints with no delays. Palestinians are always stopped and searched.

Now, I will prove to you how the apartheid wall is completely useless for keeping suicide bombers out of Israel.

We stuck four white people in the front seat of that bus, and we drove through the checkpoint without so much as a second glance from the soldiers. All the kids cheered.

Now see how easy it is to sneak Palestinians (legally or illegally) into Israel? The inherent racist legal system allows it. As long as you are white, you can go though many checkpoints in a car unhindered and unquestioned. Because it's so easy, if a Palestinian really wants to enter Israel badly enough, he or she will find a way.

Perhaps, then, someone can explain to me how the Lebensraum Separation Wall is helping to improve Israel's security against bombers?

Beowulf - The Hub, Edinburgh, 22 August 2007

This was one of a series of performances by Benjamin Bagby in which he recites the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf (strictly speaking just the most famous segment which is roughly the first third of the full text, but still over a thousand lines) while accompanying himself on a reconstruction of an Anglo-Saxon harp (rather like a six-string lyre). The recitation (in Old English with English surtitles) fell into a strange middle ground between speech and song which was the fruit of much research into what can be discovered or inferred of Anglo-Saxon story-telling technique. Bagby makes the point in his programme note that when he listened to recordings by experts on Old English verse they all seemed to emphasise the metre in a heavy-handed, leaden kind of way, whereas what he has tried to do is keep the metre always present in the listener's mind without its dominating the presentation. That seems to me analogous to Peter Hall's approach to the speaking of Shakespearean verse, where you never for a moment treat it as prose, and you use the rhythm and the metre as springboards for your speaking of the lines, but you're not plodding through metrical feet, you're speaking English while remembering it's verse. I mean, what would you think of an actor whose Hamlet spoke like &amp;quot;To BE or NOT to BE that IS the QUEST ion&amp;quot;? Yet it's impossible to speak the line correctly without awareness that it's an iambic pentameter. Well, that's where we recently were with Anglo-Saxon recitation. I can happily report that Benjamin Bagby lived up to his own principles and gave us a wonderfully flexible performance where rhythm and alliteration were evident rather than obvious.

It's a great story, of course, of a Danish king Hrothgar whose new mead-hall (Heorot) is receiving nightly visits from the local lake monster Grendel (a curmudgeon who is fed up with the noise of partying, basically). Grendel turns the place into a House of Blue Leaves every night. Then one day, a plucky Geat (or Goth, or what we would call a Swede) by the name of Beowulf turns up. He is immensely strong and competent, and has come with a small band to help out Hrothgar. He and his band bed down in the mead-hall overnight; Grendel turns up and eats one of the party without preamble before turning his attention to Beowulf. The latter, however, uses his famously powerful grip to put an armlock on Grendel, and after much thrashing about Grendel pulls free leaving his arm behind, before crawling off to his lake to bleed to death. Beowulf nails the arm up on the wall of Heorot (ewwww) and is duly rewarded with tons of stuff plus eternal kingly gratitude. Plus a sort of life insurance payout for the family of the guy who got eaten. Of course, there's more to it: the full thing has all kinds of asides on family history, rivalry between heroic types, funerals, etc., as well as a good line in description.

I thought when I booked it that this Official Festival event seemed to rise to the heights of Fringe Festival weirdness. Certainly the Anglo-Saxon harp was surreal, sounding very much like a banjo (imagine early Peggy Seeger, not Bela Fleck). Sometimes it's hard to tell where the cutting edges of Apollonian culture and Dionysian culture meet. But one of the great joys of Edinburgh in August is that wherever it is, chances are it's in Edinburgh somewhere.

&amp;quot;Poor Grendel's had an accident. So may you all.&amp;quot;

On Dale's recommendation, I've just bought the Seamus Heaney translation, and will be reading it this Autumn (what, don't you plan your books in advance?)

Fan Club 2 - Tuneful Classics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<POST>
<POSTER> sted by Rob @ </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> 2007-11-22T00:03:00 </POSTDATE>
A few more selected videos from YouTube, this time picking a few of my &amp;quot;classical&amp;quot; favourites. These are twentieth century classics, and should be played to anyone who thinks that means they can't be tuneful.

Let's begin with Leonard Bernstein conducting his own Candide Overture, which contains one of the all-time wonderful tunes. Actually the whole opera is sheer bliss as well as being extremely funny, but you'll need to find that out somewhere else.

Here is Martha Argerich playing the slow movement of Bartok's Third Piano Concerto, a great favourite of mine. Bartok wrote it when he knew he was dying of leukaemia, to give his piano-playing wife a bankably popular piece to play when he was gone. As befits a composer famous for his string quartets, he modelled the opening string theme on that of the slow movement if Beethoven's A minor quartet Op 132. In that case the theme is described as a &amp;quot;Hymn of thanks in the Lydian mode, on being restored to health&amp;quot; . Sadly Bartok knew his own health was beyond redemption, which adds a certain emotional kick to the movement.

Here is Claudio Abbado conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in the finale of Stravinsky's Firebird. Some nice horn playing too.

Staying with Stravinsky, here is the opening of The Rite of Spring with unusual choreography by the Frenchman Angelin Preljocaj, of whom I hadn't heard before For reasons that will rapidly be obvious, this would be a good video for getting teenage boys interested in ballet...... It breaks off at a rather arbritrary point, leaving me at least wishing there was more. And there is: here's the end of the same ballet. (Warning - not suitable for work!)

It would have been nice to be able to end this selection with Peter Schickele's Eine Kleine Nichtmusik , but it's not available. What there is, though, is a piece in a quite similar vein: one of his pieces supposedly by P D Q Bach. This one is the &amp;quot;Unbegun&amp;quot; Symphony (by analogy with Schubert's &amp;quot;Unfinished&amp;quot;, though this one lacks a first movement). The humour comes from the juxtaposition of all kinds of diverse quotations, as with EKN itself (though in the latter case there is always Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik running underneath). This video clip has helpful subtitles so you can spot them flying past. Enjoy.

This is on my sidebar (though it will presumably scroll off after a while).

Little enough, I know, but better than nothing. Do please add your name to the list.

Then again, there's this , and now might be a good time to support it.

And here you can send an email to the EU president and sign a petition to Gordon Brown (if you're British).

Here 's Amnesty International's page on the current situation in Myanmar and things you can do about it. Do them if you can.

And isn't it refreshing to find a right-wing military dictatorship that the USA isn't supporting ?

But other countries , not so much. (What a shock.)

L'Orfeo - Edinburgh Festival Theatre, 14 August 2007

There are occasions when the most accurate review of something would just consist of WOW and onomatopeic slobbery noises. This might be one of those times. Certianly the best festival event I've seen so far, and one of my top five all-time festival gigs, I would say. Ladies and gentlemen, the 2007 festival highlight has just left the building.

To begin at the beginning, the set by William Orlandi was magnificent. Not gimmicky of complicated, just very well-imagined. The best thing was the curtain which was covered in large sheets of mirror, so that from the balcony we could see anything going on in the stalls. The first such going-on was actually the coming-on of Jordi Savall who was conducting. He came on during the first of the three opening fanfares. Both he and the orchestra (Le Concert des Nations) were dressed in 17th century costumes, black with white trim. (Savall had a little tassled neck ornament which Hilary reckoned made him look as though he was wearing an iPod.) Sylvia made her entrance and exit through the auditorium as well. Gilbert Deflo's direction was extremely assured. L'Orfeo can be a very static opera by modern standards; in such cases directors are sometimes tempted to get gimmicky. But this one was played dead straight, in classical costume and with no histrionics added. It is a measure of Deflo's achievement that at no time did the opera become boring. It isn't long (about 140 minutes) but it fairly flew. The characters engaged our sympathy and came to life, and if you can make that happen you don't need gimmicks. Special mention also for the dancers, who were not only rhythmic and flexible but dramatically convincing. Again, the choreography by Veronica Endo was imaginative but simple.

Musically it really could not have been better. I knew Jordi Savall mainly from the soundrtack for Tous les Matins du Monde , and otherwise just by reputation. Clearly a well-deserved one. Since our recording (Harnoncourt) was made, the fashion in Monteverdi tempi has become quicker. The advantage of this for something like L'Orfeo is that the slow pieces can avoid becoming draggy but the contrast between slow and fast tempi can be preserved. The chorus work by La Capella Reial de Catalunya was first-class, and there wasn't a single weak link in the cast. It was rather a family show, with Montserrat Figueras (Mrs Savall) as La Musica, and their daughter Arianna Savall as Euridice. Both were particularly good, but the palm must go to Orfeo himself (Furio Zanasi) for singing as good as any I've heard on a stage. I was just looking at the cast list: the shepherds and spirits were good, but every single named character was simply flawless. I was, and remain, gobsmacked.

This year is the 400th anniversary of the first performance, and as a result there are a number of Orfeos being mounted around the world. I feel safe in asserting that none of them will come anywhere near the standard of Tuesday's performance (which was the third and last, though I gather they were all magnificent).

Um, I said it isn't . long, abut 140 minutes. Which reminds me of the split-screen gag in Annie Hall:

Psychiatrist: how often do you have sex?

Annie Hall: oh, all the time...about once a week.

Alvy Singer: hardly ever...about once a week.

You just wanted to crow about seeing another Ring,didn't you? I'm (a bit) jealous. I've only seen two as full cycles over a week or two (Scottish Opera and ENO), but can count another couple of cycles rolled out at a rate of one per year (Scottish Opera and Edinburgh Players Opera Group, which I play for. (Oh, and Ring Around the Ring which edits it down into a single evening of about six hours for ballet purposes.) If anyone thinks listening to sixteen hours of Wagner is a test of stamina, trying playing it. If my shoulder is back to full fitness I'm due to do Meisteringer at the end of September. No easier. (Oddly it's Rheingold in many ways that's the killer because of the lack of interval. Plus right at the end you have to play the entry Of the Gods into Valhalla, so you need something in reserve.)

Mike at Troubled Diva has just posted his interview with Donny Osmond. Of which I am very jealous.

Perhaps not surprisingly I wasn't a fan of The Osmonds as a band: caught me at the wrong age, I guess, and not really my style anyway. But Donny's later career has impressed me: not just Joseph, but guesting on Dweezil Zappa's version of Stayin' Alive . The man has class.

I'e just been reading about a fantastic addition to the University of Edinburgh's museum of musical instruments. Apparently Sir Nicholas Shackleton, an eminent palaeoclimatoligist, collected clarinets. About eight hundred clarinets, in fact, and he's now left them to the university. They range from early 18th century versions (remember the clarinet is quite a recent invention) through the various improvements and attempted improvements in design that led to the modern instrument, along with some byways and oddities. Most of the Shackleton Bequest instruments are in playable condition, which is impressive in itself, and will make the collection a seriously useful research tool. See here for an article about the collection (pp 22-23).

Another thing for me to find time to go and see....(still haven't been to the Andy Warhol exhibition - waiting until the Festival's over and the queues die down).

Many years ago, when my wife Hilary still taught clarinet to secondary school kids, she had a particulary apt pupil who decided to enter for the BBC's Young Musician of the Year contest. (In the event, like most entrants, she was eliminated before the bits that get shown on TV.) The BBC provided various stipulations regarding the pieces she was required to play for the elimination round. They didn't specify individual pieces, but required at least one piece from each of various historical periods. The one that interested us was the apparently arbitrary &amp;quot;At least one piece composed after 1962&amp;quot;. It was a while before we twigged that this was to prevent people using the Poulenc Clarinet Sonata as their &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; work. (The Poulenc, while not easy, is hugely popular as well as being fairly conservative in style. It's still a lovely piece, and of course entrants could still play it: they just had to come up with something newer as well.) We scrathched our heads, as Hilary isn't a modern music specialist and disn't have very many things that filled the bill. Then I remembered that I had bought her (as a &amp;quot;thank you for having me&amp;quot; present on behalf of our newborn daughter) a CD of music for solo clarinet (also for solo basset horn) by Karlheinz Stockhausen. There was a splendidly approachable little piece on it called &amp;quot;Sei wieder froh!&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Cheer up!&amp;quot;) , under a minute long. Better still, the CD booklet reproduced the entire manuscript. Yippee! A quick burst of neat longhand copying, and Hilary's pupil was set up. I believe she enjoyed playing the piece.

On our way to the Music Club gig on Tuesday, Hilary and I were talking about what we might do if we were prevailed on to organise an evening's programme. I suggested she might do &amp;quot;Sei wieder froh!&amp;quot;, and she sounded quite enthusiastic. Who knows?

Then on my way back from Glasgow last night (I'd been to hear the BBCSSO doing Bartok's The Miraculous Mandarin , which was excellent) I passed this lorry, and whipped out my cellphone for a picture:

So it was strange, with the man having been on my mind this week, to discover that I had missed the notices of his death last week. Here is the Guardian , and here is the Times .

Here, in considerable detail, is Wikipedia on the man and his work.

By way of a tribute, I have been accompanying my blogging tonight with a Stockhausen soundtrack. First, Kontakte played very loudly through headphones, which is pretty shattering but stopped interference from my son's band who were rehearsing at the other end of the house. Then (and as I type) Hymnen , which contains my favourite example of Stockhausen humour, to wit a section entitled Sumpf-Enten quaken die Marseillaise (marsh ducks quack the Marseillaise). It does what it says on the tin.

Finally, when I saw this picture:

I was reminded of this:

Humour and space. I think Karlheinz would have enjoyed the comparison.

Udge - there are still some fairly well-known songs in there. One of the more obscure ones is by a German sister act (they sang in English but weren't known over here at all AFAIK), and was a moderate hit in Germany for them some years back. I wondered if you might have got it.

As for the oddness, I do have a T-shirt which reads &amp;quot;I listen to music you've never heard of&amp;quot;. Just be thankful I didn't pick my latest Oxfam vinyl purchase: Stockhausen's Mikrophonie I and Mikrophonie II . The second is choral so I could have....

One of the big stories this week in the Arab world (though strangely not here in Britain......) was the deliberate shooting in the foot by an IDF soldier of a blindfolded and handcuffed Palestinian prisoner . How heroic. What an example to the rest of us of Israeli "purity of arms"l.

And of course the Israeli authorities treat all such occurrences really seriously .

Meanwhile in the private sector, "settlers" from a terrorist training camp seminary demonstrated their peace-loving nature by smashing and looting a Palestinian village before showing their commitment to Israel by threatening to murder an IDF soldier. Yet somehow they all survived without being shot. How amazing.

And did you notice the reference in that report to the Israeli settler who launched a rocket attack on a Palestinian village? Obviously that never happened, because the whole world knows that it's only the wicked Palestinians who shoot rockets indiscriminately at Israelis, while the pure and moral Israelis only ever murder those who deserve it .

Now let's all watch the likes of Judith Weiss and the other apologists for Israeli terrorism (remember kids, the bombing of the King David Hotel may have killed a lot of people but (a) the oh-so-moral Zionists gave a warning first and (b) the victims weren't Jewish, so who gives a fuck?) falling over themselves to deny that the rocket attack ever happened. After all, if you can cheerfully pretend that 10% of the Nazi Holocaust didn't happen (come on, the Jews who were socialists or gays had it coming, right?) where's the difficulty in sweeping the odd Israeli wannabe mass-murderer under the rug? Hey, Weiss airbrushed Baruch Goldstein out of history: she accused me of an anti-semitic smear - how original! - when I mentioned him on her blog, though of course when I came up with detailed references she went very quiet, which is what Zionists do instead of apologising for their own smears and slander. Well, that and banning their critics from their blogs. (Banned from Kesher Talk, and prouder of it than you could imagine.)

And the only Western sources to carry the story? The UN and the International Solidarity Movement (both denounced as terrorist organisations by Weiss et al). Which tells you all you need to know about the supposed "anti-Israeli bias" of the Western liberal media, wouldn't you say?

Tonight my children and I (Hilary was playing in the pit for an opera) went to hear a talk by Robert Swan , the first man in history (as he puts it) stupid enough to walk to both the South and North poles. While most of his talk described his various expeditions and exploits, the focus of his career has very much been on protecting the environment. I suppose it's not surprising that he would be excited by the need to protect Antarctica: when walking to the South Pole he suffered some facial damage and eye damage (his irises changed colour, for heaven's sake) from the intensity of UV, which was worse than had been anticipated because of the not then well-known hole in the ozone layer. Still, as he pointed out, the ozone hole is a very good example of what can be achieved when governments and industry decide to take an environmental problem seriously: it has now stabilised and is expected to repair itself over the next 20 years or so. But, he asked, did we know about that? Mostly not: because it's a good news story about the environment, and it's doom and gloom that sells papers.

In general - as that remark might suggest - he seems to take a very sensible line on environmental matters. For example, while he praised Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth, he did say that not everything in it was correct. And one of his remarks echoed one that I make so often that my kids make bo-ring faces at it: a lot of people talk about &amp;quot;saving the planet&amp;quot; when the planet will look after itself just fine - it's continued human involvement in it that's under threat. But he definitely walks the walk (no pun intended) as well as talking the talk, and next year he will be living in Antarctica for a few weeks, kept alive solely by renewable (solar and wind) power - the first time anyone has attempted such a feat.

A remarkable man, and I'm glad I got to see him. Incidentally, the name of his web site refers to the fact that in 2041 the current legal protections on Antarctica expire and if governments haven't been persuaded of the need to keep Antarctica as a jointly owned nature reserve, it could be opened up for mining. He said that the craziest thing he knew of in his lifetime was the frenzy by the USA, Russia, Canada and Denmark to establish ownership of the area around the North Pole. The reason for the struggle is that because of global warming it's now accessible, and the motivation is the rights to sub-Arctic mineral wealth, especially oil....use of which is a major contributor to that same warming that has made it accessible. Aaargh. (Or as Richard Wagner put it, &amp;quot;Wahn, Wahn, überall Wahn!&amp;quot;)

Some wonderful quotations from Frank Zappa, collected here .

You see, when I was a kid I used to save up for a month, so I could get
an R&amp;amp;B album and, the same day, the complete works of Anton Webern.
Maybe that means something. Maybe that tells you something about my music.

I was writing all kinds of positive and negative canons and weird inverted this and retrograde that and getting as spaced-out mathematically as I could and I was going&amp;quot;Wait a minute (laughs), who cares about that stuff?&amp;quot; I had always liked rhythm and blues so here I was stuck between the slide rule and the gut bucket somewhere and I decided that I would opt for a third road someplace in between.

A mind is like a parachute. It doesnt work if it's not open.

Interviewer: The notion of a &amp;quot;guitar solo&amp;quot; has preconceptions based on it; people automatically refute it because it's supposed to be self-indulgent or &amp;quot;for musicians.&amp;quot; It's almost like things become iconographic and somehow lose their value for outsiders.

Zappa: Well, who's fault is that? That's what writers do. Musicians don't do that. The average person doesn't sit around thinking about &amp;quot;iconographic problems of a guitar solo.&amp;quot;

Some people crave baseball -- I find this unfathomable -- but I can easily understandwhy a person could get excited about playing a bassoon.

If it can be conceived as music, it can be executed as music, and presented to an audience in such a way that they will perceive it as music: &amp;quot;Look at this.Ever seen one of these before? I built this for you. What do you mean, 'What the fuck is it?' It's a goddam ETUDE, asshole.&amp;quot;

You can't always write a chord ugly enough to say what you want to say, so sometimes you have to rely on a giraffe filled with whipped cream.

A comment over at Head On A Stick (the LiveJournal caravan parked outside EKN's noble edifice) reminded me of these , which I first encountered on Radio 3's Music Weekly a long time ago (maybe even in the 1970s). They are very silly, but are actually pretty good fits for the music, and memorable because of their silliness. If I ever needed to remember how the 48 fugue subjects go, this is how I'd do it.

Mordechai Vanunu is a brave man who helped to publicise the Israeli clandestine nuclear programme (which remains to this day uninspected and totally unregulated, unlike those of for example Iran and Saddam's Iraq). For his services to humanity he was rewarded by being kidnapped, illegally abducted to Israel, tried in secret and locked up as a prisoner of conscience for 18 years. He made it into the Guinness Book of Records as having spent more time in solitary confinement than anyone else in the modern era (if one can use that phrase with regard to Israel). On the expiry of his sentence*, he was rearrested on charges of having attempted to exercise his rights under the UN Universal Charter of Human Rights to freedom of expression and to attempting to leave his country. In all, Vanunu has been treated by Israel in just the way the Russians and East Germans used to treat their dissidents.

Here is the text of a motion to the Scottish Parliament from Margo MacDonald asking for the government's support to end the persecution of Vanunu; along with a list of the responses received. I'm not terribly surprised that my constituency MSP David McLetchie didn't bother to reply, as he has never replied to anything I've sent him either (the phrase &amp;quot;waste of space&amp;quot; might have been invented for him). Of course, he may have had pressing financial business to arrange.

You may form your own opinion of the few MSPs who refused to support the motion. I know I have.

Other links from this page take you to calls from Scottish University rectors and religious leaders for Vanunu's release, as well as an online petition which I urge you to sign.

Mordechai Vanunu will never be free until he escapes from Israel: there will always be some trumped-up reason to jail him. One can only hope, though that once he has escaped from its clutches even the shameless Ehud Olmert will hesitate before having him illegally kidnapped again.

At this time of year we celebrate the birth of another Jewish hero who found that speaking the truth doesn't make you popular in the short term. Let's celebrate, then, the good things that can come out of Israel: and try to ensure that Vanunu can, indeed, come out of Israel.

(* Benjamin &amp;quot;Cunt&amp;quot; Kerstein considers it a &amp;quot;disgusting miscarriage of justice&amp;quot; that Vanunu was released when his sentence ran out, thus showing that his comprehension of justice and sentencing is no better than his knowledge of physics , writing, Noam Chomsky or, well, anything except Hebrew obscenity. &amp;quot;Needless to say&amp;quot;, anyone Kerstein despises is likely to be a more than usually decent human being. But, hey, Christmas spirit and all: you can't help being an ignorant dick, Benjamin, so have a happy Christmas.)

To celebrate the 40th anniversary of BBC Radio 3, record producer Joe Boyd (the guy who signed up Pink Floyd, Donovan, Fairport Convention, Nick Drake, The Incredible String Band, Vashti Bunyan and my pals The Purple Gang) hosted two programmes ( 1 2 )wherein he played his &amp;quot;top forty&amp;quot; world music tracks. He then asked listeners to send in comments and suggestions for a final programme which he would be hosting with Lucy Duran.

Here's what I sent him.

Greetings!

First of all, thanks for the amazing bands you've helped on their way in your years in the business. When I was at school I played in a folk group with Joe Beard, formerly (and now, again) with The Purple Gang. A formative experience, especially when (with Trevor Crozier) we made it to the main stage at the Cambridge Festival. So for the Gang, Pink Floyd, Fairport, the ISB and the rest: thanks.

Thinking of Trevor Crozier puts me in mind of a record you should maybe feature in your next programme: &amp;quot;Giles Farnaby's Dream Band&amp;quot;. (My favourite track is &amp;quot;Shrewsbury Lasses&amp;quot;, but any would do.)

The Orsa Spelman track was great, but I'd love to hear some more Scandinavian artists. Gåte, for example, whose track &amp;quot;Knut liten og Sylvelin&amp;quot; from the album &amp;quot;Isolilja&amp;quot; raises the bar extremely high for any subsequent users of electronics in traditional music. As does almost anything by Sorten Muld, especially &amp;quot;The Man and the Elf-Girl&amp;quot;. Moving to less experimental ground, Hedningarna's &amp;quot;Karelia Visa&amp;quot; album combining Finnish vocalists and a Swedish band is full of gems, most famously &amp;quot;Forest Maiden&amp;quot;. Finally, if you're willing to have a group performing original material with heavy folk influences (and after Baba Yaga you might be!) there's Nordman: like a reinvented Giles Farnaby's Dream Band with Rod Stewart singing in Swedish. What's not to love? Favourites would be &amp;quot;Det Sista du Ser&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ännu Glöder Solen&amp;quot; and especially &amp;quot;Om Hon Will det Själv&amp;quot;.

However, your playing of some Malagasy music as well as Shoukichi Kina emboldens me to suggest possibly my all-time favourite world music track. From Henry Kaiser &amp;amp; David Lindley's first &amp;quot;A World Out Of Time &amp;quot; anthology, it is &amp;quot;Hana&amp;quot; by Tarika Sammy (a Malagasy cover of SK's greatest hit &amp;quot;Flowers For Your Heart&amp;quot;). Sheer bliss.

I look forward to hearing your next show whether you play any of my suggestions or not, and wish you many more years of inspiring us all.

Well, the programme came around, and I was mentioned on air! Lucy Duran mentioned my suggestion of Hedningarna (managing in the process to mispronounce both my own name and the band's!). Much to my surprise they didn't have a copy of Karelia Visa available so they played a track from Kaksi . Oh well. I still think Knut liten og Sylvelin by Gåte would have been better (or anything from Giles Farnaby's Dream Band ), but it's good to have had one's contribution acknowledged.

A propos Giles Farnaby's Dream Band , I note that vinyl versions like my own are going for £81 (and elsewhere for 150 Euros) online. and that there is now a CD issue. I commend it to you all, not just because one of the leaders of GFDB was the late Trevor Crozier (mentioned above, and my brother's best man) but because it's the only record I have ever played that has literally caused someone (a very attractive young lady, moreover) to bang on my door and ask what the amazing music was that she could hear.

Oh, and the title: my friend Chris Eyre used to be able to boast proudly that Trevor Crozier's dog owed him a pint (he still could, though both dog and owner are long deceased.) Rose, a magnificent lurcher (&amp;quot;Understands every word I say: doesn't take a blind bit of notice&amp;quot; - TC) had a party trick of drinking beer or (even better) cider out of pint tankards (there was some complex business with nose and paw that rendered it possible). So endearing was this that she was forever being provided with drinks on which to practise it (but not, I should add, to the extent that she was at any risk of intoxication - Trevor rationed her performances). She had a pint of cider off Chris.

Here 's a link that gives a decent potted bio of Trevor. Though I wouldn't recommend you to buy Trouble Over Bridgewater : I had a copy and gave it to Oxfam. Despite the inclusion of Barry Dransfield among the &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot;, it doesn't show Trev in a good light. The new material is weak, and the old stuff is noowhere near as god as the studio versions. A pity, because Trev could be wonderful live. (I remember him filling a brief but unexpected hiatus between acts at the Poynton Folk Festival with a marvellous - and understated - version of Percy French's very funny Mary Anne McHugh .) A Parcel of Old Crams is good though, and if you ever spot a copy of the Lyonesse album, buy it and tell me so I can hate you . (No, I don't have a copy, why do you ask?)

Festival Fringe - Charlie Victor Romeo

As the film festival has now moved forward so it doesn't coincide with all the other Edinburgh festivals, I declare today to be the official start of the festivalling season. Yay!

And I began with a play, Charlie Victor Romeo : that is, CVR , that is, Cockpit Voice Recorder. We didn't get any programmes or anything like that, so all I can tell you about the production is that it was by Scamp Theatre in association with Mercury Colchester and Theatre Royal Bury St Edmunds. The six actors (4 male, 2 female) were from their accents clearly American (or possibly Canadian). (Update: they are named in this slideshow from the play's website.) The play is based on real-life transcripts of cockpit voice recordings (well, duh) from air emergencies, six in all. At the start of each segment they flash up when, where, what kind of aircraft, what airline, how many people on board, and what went wrong. After each segment they repeat the information, with the addition of the numbers saved/killed. And it was absolutely gripping. It begins with a flight where the altimeter had been wrongly set, and where there were no casualties. Then there is a series of "no survivors" crashes, ranging from a flight where the crew had been happily chatting, unaware that their wings were icing up and about to wipe them all out, to an AWACS flight out of a USAF base which struck a flock of Canada Geese on take-off and lost the contest (shortest segment: about one and a half minutes). There is also a tragedy that seems all the worse when you know before it starts that it was totally avoidable: a maintenance crew had forgotten to remove protective tape from the inlet ports for the altitude and airspeed instruments after cleaning the aircraft. The penultimate crash I thought sounded familar, and when I looked up the play on Wikipedia I realised it was the worst single-aircraft crash in history: just four survivors from a loaded 747. The cause was a catastrophic bulkhead failure, which sounds eerily similar to last week's Qantas event , though that fortunately didn't take anything important with it when it failed.

But it's the last, and longest, segment that really takes the breath away. and I mean really : I spent a good part of the hour and a quarter of the play holding my breath, while my mouth dried up and my adrenaline levels rocketed. The final scene is a DC10 bound for Chicago, which lost an engine in an explosion which took out all three hydraulic systems and left the plane with very little vertical control and the ability to turn right but not left. After sitting with the crew for twenty-five minutes or so as they fought the stricken craft into Sioux City, Iowa with a surprising amount of residual wit ("You are clear to land on any runway" "Oh, you're getting specific: it has to be a runway, does it?") you really, really do not want the screen to flash up that they all died, and it is with great relief that I read that only (only!) 110 people died, while 198 passengers and 10 crew survived.

For anyone within range of Edinburgh over the next few weeks, it's on at the Cow Barn (which in normal life is the Reid Concert Hall) in Bristo Square. Tonight was the first performance at the Fringe: it's on until August 25th. I can't recommend it too highly: and if you can't see it in Edinburgh, watch out for it somewhere else. Fantastic theatre (and I have encountered at least as many duds as must-sees among Fringe dramatic productions over the years). I can only hope that the remaining six plays (and a musical) that I've booked to see on the Fringe delight me as much.

A great start to my festivalling, then.

You may have spotted that I'm not a big fan of Prince Charles. His sister, OTOH, has a lot more going for her. Olympic medallist, married to a college acquaintance of mine, hardest-working royal, patron of Save The Children, British rep on the International Olympic Committee, etc etc. And now a new reason to find HRH the Princess Royal rather cool: pharology .

Colour me rather jealous. We have some ace lighthouses in Scotland.

The last of those has a story attached to it. It even appears to have inspired a Doctor Who adventure.

Hmmm

When you grew up in a town a few short miles from both Highgrove and Gatcombe Park you might have a few different ideas about your royals. Charlie was a bit of a dick, but always took the time to be involved in local life. He even used to chat to my girlfriend at the time who worked in the garage where he got his petrol.

Anne, on the other hand, was vying for the award of snotty bitch of the year and not only would not speak to nasty common people but used to send police motorbikes out to clear the roads before she left her home so that she could drive down the middle of the road in regal glory.

However, I really liked first hubby Mark Phillips, who I once helped out when his horse took fright as a result of an idiot in a sports car, and who always struck me as the most friendly and normal person ever associated with that family.

I have been amused by the frenzy of New York wingnuts desperately trying to prevent President Ahmadinejad from speaking at Columbia University. I'm glad they failed. Not just because like George Bush (and this may be the only time in my life I've agreed with him) I consider it a powerful statement of America's commitment to free speech, but because if he hadn't made the speech we might never have known that the dickhead believes (or claims to) that there are no gays in Iran .

And, for that matter, that he doesn't deny the Holocaust. Nice to set that straight.

&amp;quot;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- according to this guy, there are no homosexuals in Iran. I guess that explains the pathetic state of their musical theater.&amp;quot; -- David Letterman

Well, I've seen my last film in this year's film festival (making six in all). Hereinunder * be potted reviews of them all.

(* Ain't that a great word?)

The Monastery: Mr Vig And The Nun

A lovely low-key documentary by Pernille Rose Grønkjær about an old man in Denmark who owns an old castke which he wants to have used as a monastery. He persuades the Orthodox Patriarchate of Moscow to send a priest and some nuns, one of whom is the forceful but delightful Sister Amvrosija. The film follows the building work as the castle is made ready, but it's really Mr Vig's film. An 82-year-old bachelor, he admits that he's &amp;quot;an emotional cripple&amp;quot;, unable to feel love (except for his late father) or really relate to people. The word &amp;quot;curmudgeon&amp;quot; was probably invented for Mr Vig, but Sr. Amvrosija has the measure of him in most respects. Most of the dialogue is in English, presumably because it was the only language in common between the Russians and the Dane. Sometimes it has a surreal quality, as when Mr Vig is despairing at the delapidated state of part of the castle and describes the walls as &amp;quot;worthless&amp;quot;. Sr Amrvrosija responds thay they are not worthless, they are simply &amp;quot;haunted by the weight of the roof&amp;quot;.

I was able to stay for a Q&amp;amp;A; session with the director, and as much of the session was spent talking about Mr Vig as about the film itself. Well worth seeing. I believe the DVD is coming out in September.

Teeth

A comedy horror movie by Mitchell Lichtenstein (son of the more famous Roy) about a teenaged girl with teeth in her vagina. (You heard me right the first time.) What's not to like? Jess Weixler gives a tremendous performance as Dawn in her first major film role (not unlike Alicia Silverstone or Drew Barrymore; there are a lot of sight gags and lines of dialogue which are funny when you know what's happened or is about to happen; there are three amputated penises and four-and-a-bit amputated fingers; there's a shower scene, a running operating theatre gag.... It's enormous fun (come on guys, it has a line in the credits saying &amp;quot;No man was harmed during the making of this picture&amp;quot;!) and I shall be watching out for the DVD (not sure this one will get a general cinema release.....) My only quibble is that the brooding power station behind Jess's home is apparently supposed to be a nuclear one (from interviews with the director), the idea being that Dawn's mutation has been caused by its radiation (cf Godzilla). Well, the power station belches so much smoke (see the opening page of the website!) that it never occurred to me for one moment that it was meant to be a nuclear one. Ah well.

Not one for a romantic evening in (unless you want to ensure that no sex will ensue - maybe a niche market there) but well worth watching.

I'm A Cyborg But That's OK

A film by the Korean Chan-wook Park, whose previous work I was unfamiliar with but has been recommended to me. Cyborg traces the story of a mental patient, brought in after a suicide attempt, who won't eat because she is convinced she's a robotic killer. She is befriended by one of the other patients who persuades her to eat. Weird? certainly. Interesting and thought-provoking? Check, check. But I found it just a little too odd even for me, ideally.

Strawberry Fields

I can't add much to the description I've linked, except that yes, it shows the harm that the occupation is doing not only to Palestinian farmers but to Israeli export agents through whom they have to deal. Oh, and I learned that strawberries (&amp;quot;Coral&amp;quot; brand) are the only Palestinian produce marketed in Europe as Palestinian: all the rest is branded as Israeli. Worth thinking about if you're intending to boycott Israeli produce: that a lot of the vegetables at least are actually Palestinian.

Bridge Over The Wadi

A wonderful film about an Israeli school teaching Jewish and Arab children together. There are three such schools, and this is the only one in an Arab village. My reaction was apparently typical of non-Israeli audiences, which is to say I found it a very optimistic film, giving me hope that there may come a time when the two communities aren't at each others' throats. According to Barak Heymann, who did a Q &amp;amp; A after the screening, Israeli audiences tend to be much more pessimistic, saying that if these enthusiasts for multiculturalism haven't made the school perfect (in its first year, which is what was filmed) then it's clearly a waste of time.

The film shows the kids all getting along just fine, learning each other's languages and traduitions, and making good friends. I wish could say as much for some of the parents on both sides. There was a lot of &amp;quot;Learning their language is all very well but if I suspect my child is becoming any less a Jew/Arab then I'll pull her/him out of the school&amp;quot;. And one parent at least did just that. Then we had a Jewish grandmother grilling a poor Arab kid who was playing with her grandson: &amp;quot;Do you parents tell you all about the suicide bombers?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What do you think about the bombers?&amp;quot; (Response from Arab kid: &amp;quot;I don't like it - everyone has the right to live&amp;quot;. Response from his Jewish pal: &amp;quot;He doesn't know anything about it; they don't tell him because they don't want to scare him.&amp;quot;) Grandma: &amp;quot;They think their children have the right to live but they don't tell them about the suicide bombers.&amp;quot; And on, and on. And just when you're wishing a bomber would in fact take out the evil old hag, we switch to another pair of firm friends, girls this time. We see them having a slumber party at the Jewish girl's home, and then we see the Arab girl's Dad. Asked by the Jewish girl what he'd say if his daughter said she was in love, he simply said that was forbidden, that it wasn't how they did things, that he wouldn't listen. sked by the cameraman (Barak) what he'd say if his daughter was 25 and wanted to go and live by herself (apparently the original question was even blander, stressing that she had been a model daughter and so on). The response came, deadly serious, that he would shoot her. The Jewish friend was shocked by this: the Arab daughter herself was very quiet and thoughtful, as well she might be. The again, we saw a Jewish mother saying she thought her child was making friends with people who would grow up and kill them, and a Jewish child explaining to his colleagues (Jew and Arab) that when the Jews grew up they'd have to join the army and kill Arabs whether they wanted to or not.

The parent I liked best was the only one of the Jewish parents at the school to be in the army. His daughter (the one whose Arab friend had the murderous Dad) said she had homework: they'd had to pick a question from a list to discuss with their parents and answer. The one she'd picked was &amp;quot;Does Israel have the right to exist?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Couldn't you have picked an easier one?&amp;quot; asked her father. &amp;quot;Isn't it easy?&amp;quot; she replied (which I thought was rather a good response, actually.) Her father explained that the Jews had been kicked out of their land a long time ago, and had returned to it in 1947 because they'd never forgotten it, just as though their family had had to leave their house but had always remembered it. Then when they came back they forgot that there were people now living in the house/country, and that they hadn't done anything wrong, and should be treated with respect. That, he said, was the mistake Israel made. (And I feel it applies equally to the Palestinian &amp;quot;right of return&amp;quot; to their expropriated property.)

It was that soldier's daughter who was so moved by the story of the Naqba (the expulsion of the Arabs to form Israel) that she felt like crying when she thought about it, because it was her people who had done this horrible thing. I like to think that maybe someone took her aside and said &amp;quot;Look, what happened, happened. What's important most is that Jews and Arabs treat each other decently today. And you are very important in that, because you're one of very few Jews who have an Arab as a best friend; who knows how to speak some Arabic; who doesn't think of Arabs simply as potential suicide bombers who shouldn't be in Israel at all. It's people like you who are the future of Israel, because without you Israel doesn't have a future. After all, how many Jews remember the Naqba at all on Independence Day?&amp;quot; (Naqba Day for the Arab community).

The film-makers shot 468 hours of footage for the one-hour film. Much of it was about the problems in establishing the school, with parental suspicion and government indifference or hostility. That all ended up in the bin, and instead they told the story of the first year of actual operation. I am happy to report that the school doubled its intake the next year, and has continued to grow until now it's in its fourth year.

Weirdsville

Another great black comedy, rather like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels meets Cheech and Chong, set in Canada. With added dwarfs. In chain mail. And Satanists. Best line: the lead Satanist dismisses a helper from their ritual site &amp;quot;Walk in the ways of Satan (don't step on the pentagram!)&amp;quot;. Wes Bentley (American Beauty,. Ghost Rider) was very good as one of the stoners.

An excellent if rather dispiriting post from Craig Murray all about the dwindling level of support available to Brits abroad from their embassies. Two brief samples:

I would be the last to argue that British people abroad are always deserving.......I once tried to go to the aid at midnight of a British citizen who had been arrested in Poznan, Poland. He was accused of sexual assault on a girl in the Poznan Hotel.

He worked for a big name merchant bank in London. After speaking to the Polish police and persuading them to release his arms, which were handcuffed behind his back, I asked him what had happened. He replied:
“Listen here you little shit. I earn more than a month than you’ll see in a lifetime. Now get me out of here, or I’ll make sure it’s the end of your career.”
I motioned to the police to lock him up again. Sadly I believe he did eventually succeed in buying his way out of prosecution.

=============================================

A recently retired senior diplomat, Carne Ross, in his book “Independent Diplomat” says the FCO has “A culture of amorality”. I would put the same point another way – most FCO employees just don’t care. This came home to me most strongly in the FCO when I failed to persuade an officer in our Embassy in Switzerland to leave a dinner party and open up the Embassy at night to quickly issue an emergency passport to a mother whose daughter was in intensive care in Manchester after a car crash. The passport was given the next day, and the woman reached the hospital less than an hour after her daughter died.

Like Craig Murray , I can't really find words to express what I feel about this story .

The real estate company also offered him one of the houses worth 38 million yuan (five million dollars), the Guangzhou Daily said.

The newspaper did not say whether he accepted the villa

...but as neither Tone not Morticia ever passed up an opportunity to put their snouts (and frequently their entire bodies) in the trough when he was PM, I think we can guess.

I await with interest the next special interest group to buy a piece of Blair. As the man who was so successful at bringing democracy to Iraq is now using his silky skills to bring peace to Palestine, perhaps an arms company would like to put him on its payroll.

Oh...wait.....

....then we take the world. Or the Commonwealth at least.

Great news for Glasgow, and I'm sure we'll go to some of the events in seven years' time.

To judge from the TV news tonight, my friend Emma who gets fed up with hearing Chelsea Dagger every time Celtic score a goal would do well to avoid Glasgow for a few days, as it seemed to be playing in the background of all the reports from the city tonight.

I'm sorry, I couldn't resist dropping back in to share this gem with you.

Yup, Benjamin Expletive-Undeleted Kerstein seriously believes (or did back in 2003) not only that Tony Blair, the most anti-European Prime Minister of my lifetime, is &amp;quot;irredeemably dedicated to the EU monster state (sic)&amp;quot; but that in some way unknown to those of us who merely live in his country, he planned to put Britain on the Euro. This would be despite his own and his Chancellor's implacable opposition to just such a move (Blair never suggested a referendum until public opinion, which had been fairly evenly spilt, swung strongly against the Euro so that he knew it would be lost; Brown has never given the idea a moment's thought in his life).

I agree, though, that Britain's greatness always came from its independence from the barbarians: and it is that independence - from the USA - that Blair so thoughtlessly tossed away in the vain hope of looking big and clever. It didn't work, which is why he was binned and has already been largely forgotten.

Let's add politics and economics to the subjects on which Kerstein talks through his capacious butt.

And I want to know this: Kerstein left the USA purportedly because of the dreadful anti-semitism there (no, really). Surely this couldn't be connected with the difficulty of getting into universities in his home neighbourhood of New England, compared with the, er, less rigorous requirements of the &amp;quot;Ben Gurion University of the Negev&amp;quot;? Well, he graduated from that august institution and was full of the Master's degree in Jewish History he was about to undertake at Tel Aviv University. Then we hear of him moving to Jerusalem to become assistant editor of Azure magazine. So what about the degree? Were the exacting standards of a proper university too much for the boy wonder? Or was it never any more than another Kerstein invention?

Muslims Against Sharia congratulate David Horowitz FREEDOM CENTER and Mike Adams, Tammy Bruce, Phyllis Chesler, Ann Coulter, Nonie Darwish, Greg Davis, Stephen Gale, David Horowitz, Joe Kaufman, Michael Ledeen, Michael Medved, Alan Nathan, Cyrus Nowrasteh, Daphne Patai, Daniel Pipes, Dennis Prager, Luana Saghieh, Rick Santorum, Jonathan Schanzer, Christina Sommers, Robert Spencer, Brian Sussman, Ed Turzanski, Ibn Warraq and other speakers on the success of the Islamofascism Awareness Week.

Islamofascism (or Islamism) is the main threat facing modern civilization and ignorance about this threat is astounding. We hope that this event becomes regular and reaches every campus.

A great many Westerners do not see the clear distinction between Islam and Islamism (Islamofascism). They need to understand that the difference between Islam and Islamism (Islamofascism) is the same as the difference between Christianity and Christian Identity Movement (White Supremacy Movement).

Oh look, the Zionazis have a spambot.

My use of the word &amp;quot;Zionazi&amp;quot; (which I don't in fact like) is intended top emphasise that as far as I'm concerned the main threat facing &amp;quot;modern civilsation&amp;quot; (as oppsed to ancient civilisations such as Iraq and Persia) is fuckwits who believe that &amp;quot;Islamofascism&amp;quot; is a word signifying some objective reality rather than a mere term of ignorant abuse such as &amp;quot;Zionazi&amp;quot;.

As &amp;quot;Muslims Against Sharia&amp;quot; praise Ann Coulter and Daniel Pipes, who make no distinction between Islam and Islamism, I think we may safely conclude that they have as much to do with Islam as I have to do with Orthodox Judaism.

Please drop by again, Fascists Againt Multiculturalism; and I do so hope that you've put me on one of your blacklists, as I'd truly hate to be part of any organisation tnat lets creeps like you in.

Rob,

If you weren't such a moron, you'd known that &amp;quot;Islamofascism&amp;quot; was coined by Algerian Muslims and that Coulter and Pipes draw a distinction between Islam and Islamofascism. But since your echo chamber does not allow outside opinions, you are likely to remain an ignorant ass.

I'm honoured to receive hate mail from a live (from the neck down) &amp;quot;Muslim&amp;quot; as well as from its spambot. Its wording could have come from any one of the Kesher Talk Islamophobes: do Pipes and Horowitz give these muppets style manuals as well as political indoctrination?

Happy to remain ignorant of your genuinely fascist ideology, &amp;quot;Muslim&amp;quot;.

P.S.&amp;quot;Muslim&amp;quot; - because unlike you I'm actually interested in freedom of speech, I'm letting you comment here. I see you suppressed my response to your post on your own blog. How typical.

And how typical that you not only pretend to be a Muslim but purport (on your Blogger profile) to be from Afghanistan, which my blog statistics easly disprove (from the time you posted the comment, you're from Washington DC - surprise, surprise). Clearly your commitment to the truth is as great as your commitment to freedom.

Don't trip over your armband on the way out.

The Guardian has been running a 1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die series. I viewed it with a mixture of unfamiliarity (divided into that-sounds-interesting and wha?), smugness (divided into I've-got-that-one and why-didn't-they-pick-the-next-album), general vague approval and the odd they-have-to-be-joking. One of the that-sounds-interestings, I thought, was this . And before you write off my credibility totally, read the Guardian's description of it.

Anyway, the topic of the aforementioned young ladies came up when I was chatting with my daughter, who combines my eclecticism and a degree of teenage cool. She agreed with the Guardian, so off to the my local library to borrow the CD go I.

Also, she showed me this video which I hadn't seen. It's part of Comic Relief (an annual BBC TV comedy night raising funds for charity) and features Sugababes and Girls Aloud (two famous British girl bands) covering a rightly famous Run DMC/Aerosmith video. Great fun. (Sugababes are the trio on the right.)

Oh, and Girls Aloud feature (prominently, one might think) in the forthcoming St Trinian's movie. (And the &amp;quot;Rob, UK&amp;quot; in the comments? Nope, not this one.)

A bunch of failed American ex-academics trying to blacken the name of a real one (well, several actually)

I'd been meaning to post a link to this piece in 5th October's Guardian , as it summed up a lot of my feelings on the matter. While not supporting a generalised boycott of Israeli academia, I have some misgivings about such a boycott's having been declared unlawful, especially as no reasons have been given in support of such an opinion.

The threats cited by Dr Gopal to academic freedom in the United States are well-known:

Organisations such as Campus Watch monitor what academics write and teach, compile blacklists and attempt to shut down debate, despite their claim to support free speech. Respected scholars who have faced campaigns include Columbia University's Middle East specialist Joseph Massad, who was accused and then cleared of anti-semitism; outspoken Michigan professor Juan Cole; and Norman Finkelstein, refused tenure and forced to resign after DePaul University came under external pressure.

Well, clearly she touched a nerve at Campus Watch, as their apparatchik Winfield Myers (apparently a &amp;quot; journalist and public intellectual &amp;quot;) published this attack :

A cursory look at CW's web pages would have saved Gopal from, at least, errors of fact, if not from those rooted in her ideology.

To state the obvious: CW does not compile blacklists; where does she see them on our site?

Well, to state the obvious, things can exist without being publicised on a website. (I have a diary, but you won't see it here.) Anything better?

As for the tired charge that CW aims to &amp;quot;shut down debate,&amp;quot; it is rather the case that Gopal and her allies are so unused to debate of any kind that the mere appearance of alternative views causes them to swoon and cry foul. I invite critics to tell us precisely what mechanisms we use for achieving this grand claim. They cannot, of course, for we neither wish it nor have it within our means to achieve it.

Well, if you visit the &amp;quot;About Us&amp;quot; page at CW's site, it lists its aims as:

Campus Watch, a project of the Middle East Forum, reviews and critiques Middle East studies in North America, with an aim to improving them. The project mainly addresses five problems: analytical failures, the mixing of politics with scholarship, intolerance of alternative views, apologetics, and the abuse of power over students.

Then it defines all these &amp;quot;problems&amp;quot; in terms of specific opinions which academics ought or ought not to hold. For example:

...out of the Middle East Studies Association's four-day conference in November 2002 where more than 550 papers were presented, exactly one dealt with Al-Qaeda and one with &amp;quot;fundamentalism.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Militant Islam&amp;quot; was not the subject of a single paper.

Gosh. it's almost as though the Middle East Studies Association made up its own mind as to what were significant topics of discussion rather than bowing to the ill-informed prejudices of a bunch of journalists with no credibility in the subject. But Winfield Myers is still hopping about with a foot remaining to shoot off:

Gopal objects to CW's research on Joseph Massad, who was, as those who can discern gold from brass know, &amp;quot;cleared&amp;quot; only to the degree that an internal committee at Columbia denied that he is an anti-Semite.... the committee's conclusions hardly settled the matter to the satisfaction of many outside observers and members of the Columbia community.

...i.e. he was cleared but Campus Watch don't like it and will carry on pretending he wasn't....

Gopal's inclusion of Finkelstein and Archbishop Tutu in her list of supposedly silenced heroes further exposes her lack of research: we have never commissioned a single item on either man, as Campus Watch does not take positions on questions of tenure or on campus speakers.
Oh, right. I'm sure that's true, but by a strange coincidence if you click on the tab labelled &amp;quot;Moonlighting: Non-specialists in the News&amp;quot; (a bit rich, one might think, from an organisation entirely made up of non-specialists) you will see links to these articles:

Canadian Prof Attends Tehran's Gathering of Holocaust Deniers [on Shiraz Dossa]
by Doug Saunders, December 13, 2006 - The Globe and Mail

It is quite true that CW claims to take no position on academic tenure in general or Finkelstein in partucular, but that list tells a different story: dozens of links to articles critical of Finkelstein and none to the equally numerous ones supporting him. Even if one could accept that CW had no opinion on Dr Finkelstein's tenure, they act as a willing and conscious platform for those who have very strong opinions indeed. However, one can accept no such thing, as CW's founder and director Daniel Pipes has publicly described Norman Finkelstein as a Holocaust denier . This tells us a lot more about Daniel Pipes than it does about Norman Finkelstein, whose parents - unlike Pipes's who fled to America - survived both the Warsaw Ghetto and the camps (his father was at Auschwitz and his mother at Majdanek). But Finkelstein expresses dissident opinions, not rubber-stamped by Pipes and his Stalinist buddies: not over the truth of the Holocaust, or its scale, or Hitler's culpability, but over the extent to which it has nowadays become a brand, a commodity, which can be called into action to excuse any kind of law-breaking or immorality. Pipes can't deny this, so has to resort to smearing his opponent's parents. Yet Myers expects us to believe that Pipes has no opinion on Finkelstein's suitability for tenure, or that he somehow sheds his visceral hatred of the man when he logs onto Campus Watch. No wonder Myers is a &amp;quot;public intellectual&amp;quot; (i.e. a free-floating ego nobody pays to hear).

No, these guys are kooks, and dangerous kooks at that, who dream of establishing accountability among America's academics (i.e. teach what we tell you), who &amp;quot;look forward to the day when scholars of the Middle East provide studies on relevant topics&amp;quot; (just talk about terrorism and how Islam is evil - oh, and don't mention Israel at all, ever) and who call upon Middle East studies specialists to recognize their &amp;quot;correlative obligations&amp;quot; (whatever the hell they are).

Fortunately Campus Watch's inquisitorial writ doesn't extend to Oxford, where we still have people with brains and morals such as Priyamvada Gopal. That those who have neither have hounded Norman Finkelstein from office in a flurry of lies and ad hominem attacks is bad enough: that they don't even have the courage to admit it tells you all you need to know about these heroes of &amp;quot;academic freedom&amp;quot;. They're liars and cowards, who couldn't cut it in academia themselves and are driven by hatred and envy. I've mentioned Pipes before, here and here . I havn't changed my opinion of him, nor my hope that if he ever comes to the UK we arrest him for incitement to racial hatred and deport the evil lunatic.

Emerson, a Jew who gets it
A perspective of a moderate Muslim

At the risk of sounding anti-Semitic, I want to say this: either American Jews are completely clueless about the internal struggle inside Islam or they are so cowardly, that they are even afraid to voice their opinion. Or maybe it's a combination of both.

Every time there is a development that involves radical Islam, be it a Mayor of New York attending an Islamist parade, DOJ's officials attending an Islamist conference, or a protester being sued for having the balls to expose an Islamist-sponsored event at an amusement park, the American Jewish community is as quiet as a church mouse. It's like it is not even there.

The effect of this silence is devastating. Not for the Jewish community, not yet. That time is still to come. The silence affects the American Muslim community. Every time moderate Muslims are ignored and Islamists are legitimized (by either direct support from government representatives or silent support of the ADL), radicals gain ground. In the current PC climate, moderate Muslims have pretty much no choice but to keep their mouths shut.

Luckily for us, not everyone in the Jewish community is like that. There are some Jews that are speaking out. One of them is Steven Emerson, who has been warning the West about the dangers of Islamic fundamentalism since before PanAm 103. Most of his current work is focused on exposing the radicals masquerading as the moderates – those radicals who are embraced by the DOJ and the Pentagon, by the mayor of New York Bloomberg (Rudy would never get into bed with terrorist supporters) and the Treasury Department, by the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security, by the Congress and the White House.

There is a war of ideas within Islam, and moderate Muslims are losing. Most of Muslim clergy and Muslim establishment are paid for by the Wahhabis. Moderate Muslims are being run out of Mosques and community centers, and in many cases are physically threatened. Moderate Muslims have no place in the media or public debate, because the place reserved for Muslims is filled by Islamic radicals, who attempt to make criticizing anything Islamic a taboo. According to the Islamists, a Muslim can do no wrong.
1. When a non-Muslim criticizes Islam or Muslims, he/she is an Islamophobe.
2. When a Muslim criticizes Islam or Muslim, he/she is not a real Muslim, therefore see #1.

This is a tactic used by &amp;quot;moderate&amp;quot; Muslims, the darlings of the government and the media. But how can you call someone who praises bin Laden, or has ties to Hamas, or calls for the elimination of Israel, or wants to replace the Constitution with the Koran a moderate? They are anything but moderates, however nobody except for a few people like Steven Emerson seems to notice that. But even when the Emersons of America appeal to the public, they are often being dismissed as alarmists and racists. Well, they are anything, but. You don't have to be a clairvoyant to predict the future when it comes to expansion of radical Islam and extinction of moderate Muslims. All you need to do is get your heads out of the sand.

Why our government is so forgiving and forgetful when it comes to individuals or organizations with known terrorist ties and anti-American views is beyond me. Why the Jewish leaders are so timid when it comes to the subject of radical Islam is incomprehensible.

I thank God every day for people like Steven Emerson, because they are the last glimmer of hope for moderate Muslims.

K.M.

Lists of outdoor-type things are great, aren't they? There's the list of Scottish mountains over 3000 feet, aka Munros (after Sir Hugh Munro who first listed them but actually never completed the round). There are 284 of these, and I've climbed just over 100 of them (my list is in Ballater so I can't be definitive). For the more adventurous there are, well, I suppose we should call them the Messners: the fourteen summits over 8000 metres in height, , first climbed by Reinhold Messner.

Well, now there is another list awaiting emulation. Strangeways. I suspect the number of Strangeway-baggers will be closer to the total for the Messners than for the Munros.

For example, here's my own list of Strangeways (counting overnight stays only):

Fair Isle
Foula
Shetland Mainland
Eday
North Ronaldsay
Orkney Mainland
Hirta
Lewis/Harris
Uists
Mull
Arran

11 out of 162. It's a sobering thought that even adding in the ones I've visited without an overnight stay only adds a further 11. (Though obviously there are plenty I've seen from a respectful distance without landing, which is after all how most people experience Ailsa Craig, Boreray and Gruinard.) As Chip Clark commented when I posted my pictures of the far North-West, what a lot I still have to see.

Congratulations to Andy Strangeway anyway on his achievement.

You've Been Framed (German equivalent: Bitte Lächeln ) is a British TV show where viewers send in video clips of people making *****s of themselves by doing stupid (and unintentional) things on camera. And if anyone around me had had a video camera yesterday you'd be seeing me on it.

In our garden there stands (or stood) a pine tree. Hilary and I planted it about twenty years ago, since when it has continued to grow until it eventually outgrew the capacity of the soil where we'd planted it, and died. Wishing to cut it down, we acquired a chainsaw (and I bet most stories including that sentence end badly). Actually, the chainsaw part worked fine: a Health &amp;amp; Safety conscious wuss such as I was never likely to amputate bits of myself or anyone else. No, it was the tree which didn't co-operate. I'd removed branches with loppers as for up as I could reach (the tree was about fifteen feet high), and decided to drop the tree (if possible) straight into our yard area, alongside the wall separating it from the street. This nearly worked (to the delight of my watching family) except that the falling tree slightly fouled the wall, whereupon the weight of the still branch-laden top flipped it over that wall into the street. Fortunately nobody was walking by. Fortunately the car parked outside was ours. Fortunately the tree missed it (just barely). Fortunately nobody was videoing proceedings.

I must say that as I watched the tree pivot over the wall my thoughts were like those of Obi-Wan Kenobi as he watches Jango Fett's ship plummet over a precipice and realises he's still attached to it: &amp;quot;Oh, not good&amp;quot;.

I'd like to be able to claim that my Jedi reflexes and command of the force are what saved our car, but (continuing with the SF metaphors) I think a Teela Brown gene is closer to the real reason.

The tree is now in many small pieces for our cheminea, and some larger ones for a friend's wood-burning stove. Plus a heap of pine twigs which makes the yard look like a Norse artist's impression of Christ's entry into Jerusalem. Revenge is sweet.

Clare and Lisa are absolutely right: Gods Behaving Badly by Marie Phillips is officially a work of genius.

No, really. The best piece of fiction I've read for years, and really, really funny.

So now I'm wishing I'd stuck my hand in the air for an invitation to her invitation-only blog before it closed. Yes, I know she has another one , but as we don't seem to have any TV programmes in common except Doctor Who, this may not work out.

Craig Murray - Edinburgh Book Festival 27 August 2007
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<POST>
<POSTER> sted by Rob @ </POSTER>

My final visit to this year's Book Festival, to see &amp;quot;a man of integrity&amp;quot; (Harold Pinter), &amp;quot;a man of the highest principle&amp;quot; (John Pilger) or &amp;quot;a deep embarrassment to the entire Foreign Office&amp;quot; (Jack Straw). Craig Murray, as you probably know, was Britain's ambassador in Uzbekistan until he was sacked. It is as he said, quite difficult to get fired from the British diplomatic service, and the heinous offence which brought about the end of his career was an inability to keep his mouth shut about a dictator (Karimov) who had an unfortunate attachment to boiling his political opponents alive. Imagine: even though both Britain and the USA had declared Karimov a major ally in the &amp;quot;War on Terror&amp;quot;, this upstart Murray (who hadn't been to a public school or even to Oxbridge) was banging on about fingernails this and electrodes that, and sending photographs to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of people who had been mutilated and murdered. Even worse, when he discovered that the CIA were providing us with information obtained from the torture of suspects, and that this information was worthless, he had the audacity to draw the Foreign Secretary's attention to it, imagining that (as in the pre-9/11 days) anyone would give a stuff. An example of this useless intelligence was a list of &amp;quot;al-Qaeda members&amp;quot;, all of whom had apparently visited training camps in Afghanistan and met Osama bin Laden in person. (As his whereabouts were unknown at the time, it is astonishing that none of these hundreds of close associates was able to help the Allied forces to find him.) One of the people on the list was known personally to Craig, and was a Jehovah's Witness. Craig said he was unaware of any attempts by al-Qaeda to recruit Jehovah's Witnesses, though it was possible that the chap had visited Afghanistan in an attempt to sell copies of The Watchtower to al-Qaeda...) However, all was explained by the FCO: it was of no consequence whether this intelligence was true or not: what mattered was that it was &amp;quot;useful&amp;quot;. In the same way, of course, the famous &amp;quot;intelligence&amp;quot; concerning Iraqi WMDs was totally untrue, but extremely useful if one's aim was to start an illegal war.

When asked by a member of the audience what had made him decide to take a stand against torture and all Karimov's other abuses (Uzbek cotton, for example, is almost entirely the product of slave labour) he remarked that nothing had changed his mind. He had stayed the same, but British government policy toward human rights abuses had changed.

Craig Murray insists that there is nothing heroic about him, and on one level he is right: his underpants remain firmly inside his trousers (though a propos his extramarital affairs he remarked that his lack of a public school background meant that he was probably the first British ambassador to Uzbekistan who was interested in girls). However, he isn't an easy man to bully, and is patently far more intelligent (not to mention honest) than Jack Straw and all the other Blair place-men. The FCO's loss is everyone else's gain, especially bloggers of course.

I bought a copy of his book and got it signed. I asked him whether Easyjet still banned it from their flights, and he said he hadn't had any recent reports of that. But there we are: another banned dissident. Perhaps if he gets sent to the Gulag Clive Stafford Smith can defend him.

A propos the Gulag, Craig draws attention on his blog to one of our own prisoners of conscience, Marcus Armstrong . (That's &amp;quot;our own&amp;quot; in the sense that it's the British government which has locked him up to keep him quiet.) Do send him a card to cheer him up. (This year all my New Year cards to Guantanamo Bay prisoners seem to have got through; last year they were all intercepted and returned by the Americans in a stunning display of pettiness. I expect that the authorities in Kilmarnock are neither as stupid nor as vindictive as those in Guantanamo.)

one thing that stood out in your post was about Craig not having gone to public school. Nor did my dad, but he did pretty well for himself and got into london university and then had a good career within the FCO.

Actually he was asked whether he thought it had made much difference and he said not in practical terms, though socially it was a little strange at first, probably more the Dundee University than the state school. The two occasions when he mentioned it unasked were as I quoted them, and I suspect in each case it was mostly for rhetorical effect.

I haven't kept up with his blog as much as I would have liked as it's one that is blocked at my office so I can't read it with my lunch and have to remember when I get home. (Same problem as with MBIAT, actually.) I'm not sure about off the rails: he's certainly broadened his focus, but I think that's a result of no longer being constrained by government service. For instance, he was always against the Iraq war, but was very restricted in what he could say as long as he was a diplomat.

This story demonstrates a couple of things very well.

Firstly, that despite the attempts of some people to demonise the entire nation, there are plenty of decent, humane Israelis about whose compassion extends to Palestinian children.

Secondly, that they don't work in the Israeli Defence Ministry (whose negligent disregard of civilian casualties is what led to Maria's injuries and the murder of most of her family in the first place).

Way back when, I posted this about Austin Osman Spare and promised to return to the wonderful story by Francis King. Well now I can do so, in essentials at least, without having to key the whole thing in myself, as an article in Fortean Times gives a pretty good precis. Here is the relevant part:

Let's fast forward a few years to look at some of Spare's magic in practice, and to consider the beginnings of the Spare legend in his own lifetime: some of the tales that circulate about Spare make the London Borough of Lambeth seem like HP.Lovecraft's Arkham County. Three examples will be enough. The first takes place around the end of the Second World War, and is told by the late Francis X. King. A friend of King's - &amp;quot;then an art student, now a Chartered Accountant&amp;quot; - had met Spare, and the two of them had got on well. They both hated the fashions of modern art, which had become something of an obsessive topic with Spare. On the other hand, they disagreed strongly over magic, which King's friend scoffed at. When Spare mentioned that he was sometimes possessed by the spirit of William Blake, the friend countered with a stream of sympathetic psycho-babble about schizoid personalities, dissociated complexes, and the rest. This narked Spare into showing his hand: he completely believed in magic, he said, and he had actually been doing it all his life. More than that, he would give the friend a real demonstration of it next time they met.

Spare was living in a dank and mouldering basement in Brixton, and it was here the art student had his appointment with magic. It was grim in Spare's basement. It didn't smell too good, and it could be noisy, with waste pipes gurgling in the ceiling and buses driving past at street level. The friend wasn't feeling quite as phlegmatic as he had the week before. He had done a little reading in the meantime and it had made him nervous, as reading will. Nevertheless, King says, he felt his &amp;quot;firm adherence to the linguistic philosophy of A.J.Ayer would save him from being gobbled up by the demon Asmodeus or, indeed, any other unpleasantness&amp;quot;.

On entering the dread basement, the first thing the friend noticed was a marked absence of cloaks, incense, magic pentagrams, and general Dennis Wheatley paraphernalia. Spare was eating a piece of pie, and when he had finished it, the demonstration could begin. In place of the usual mystic bric-a-brac were some drawings and papers covered with letters and graphic symbols. Spare announced that he was going to attempt an &amp;quot;apportation&amp;quot;, i.e. the production of a material object from thin air. Somewhat dated now, apports were very much part of the lore of spiritualism, and were quite widely performed in the nineteenth century. Spare was going to produce living, freshly cut roses out of the atmosphere. Working in silence, he waved a drawing in the air for a minute or two before putting it back on the table. Spare was clearly concentrating very hard, and the strain was visibly showing in his face as he finally pronounced the word &amp;quot;Roses&amp;quot;. There was a moment of tense, pregnant silence before the pipe in the ceiling burst, bringing down a deluge of sewage and old bathwater on their heads.

There's a moral there somewhere, and I think it has something to do with Usmanov's being even more deeply unpleasant than the Burmese junta.

So let me get this straight. The Deputy Prime Minister of Israel is demanding the resignation of Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , on the grounds that he has taken an insufficiently tough line over Iran's non-existent nuclear weapons programme (known to be non-existent because the IAEA have inspected Iran's nuclear facilities).

This would be the Deputy PM of a country which not only has nuclear weapons but has refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or to permit any inspection of its facilities whatsoever (and which continues its vicious persecution of the only one of its citizens with both the knowledge and the guts to blow the whistle on its illegal WMD programme, and indeed of any journalist brave enough to defy Israeli government censorship and report on it).

I have heard of the pot calling the kettle black, but this, surely, is the toilet calling the operating theatre unhygienic.

A propos this story , I'm relieved that Samina Malik wasn't given a custodial sentence. It still alarms me though that somebody can be at risk of being sent to prison for the wicked offences of reading the wrong books and having impure thoughts. No wonder Blair and Bush think the Islamic world hates us because it's jealous of our freedom.(/irony)

I came upon this wonderful article by Matthew Parris in the Times when catching up on the story of Samina Malik . I was reminded of the prosecution 31 years ago of Gay News for publishing James Kirkup's rather tasteless poem . Now here we are again with a dissident poet, though probably this time being jailed rather than sued.

I thought it was places like North Korea where thinking incorrect thoughts was supposed to be a crime. Maybe in a few years visitors to Britain will be obliged to bow to statues of Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher or be punished.

Then I read this story , which brought to mind Parris's comments about Chris Langham. OK, Tibbert had actually been creating videos, so this isn't exactly a &amp;quot;thought crime&amp;quot;. But just think about it. Here we have a guy, creepy though he may be, standing in a public place, photographing children who are also in a public place. He wasn't poking his camera under toilet doors, or shooting through bedroom windows; he was filming on a public beach. It seems to ne that if you don't want your nudity or partial nudity to attract attention, you don't parade it on a beach, whether you're six or sixty. The parents of these children were perfectly happy for them to run around &amp;quot;semi-naked&amp;quot; (what that means is not made clear, though I doubt it involved erotic lingerie) until someone spotted a camera. Eh? Did they want a royalty payment? If the issue is that their kids were spotted showing more than they should, is that not the parents' problem? In any case, morality has been assuaged by Mr Tibbert's being:

-&amp;gt;banned from any beach where children are present, on pain of imprisonment;

-&amp;gt;prevented from taking any of his photographic equipment out of his house ;

-&amp;gt;barred from any contact with under-16s;

-&amp;gt;put on the Sex Offenders' Register for 3 years (despite having neither committed nor filmed any sexual act whatsoever).

I wouldn't deny that Tibbert is most likely a disturbed individual. But it seems harsh to destroy his life (and let's be clear, placing him on the Sex Offenders' Register will do that: if he's not been murdered or mutilated in three years time, he'll never be able to work, find a flat, or have any kind of a life ever again) for actions which caused no actual harm or potential harm to anyone.

In North Korea, too, it is illegal to take photographs of anything without obtaining official clearance.

Welcome to the future .

Joe seemed to like it when I linked to some video clips recently, so here are some more.

I mentioned Steve Reich's Come Out in a recent post . Here it is with some interesting choreography attached.

And here is his Clapping Music (originally for two people clapping) performed by a group of jugglers .

Here, finally, is a clip showing part of the Flying Karamazov Brothers' Marimba routine. Hilary and I saw them doing it in Edinburgh many years ago, and &amp;quot;gobsmacked&amp;quot; doesn't begin to cover it. I've just ordered a DVD of their highlights which includes it. This is the only clip I can find online, which shows them doing a little bit (with more wrong notes then when we saw them but still very impressive) for an American TV magazine programme. (Skip to 2:30 for the excerpt from Marimba .)

The piece of cod which passeth all understanding

EU quotas for cod caught by British fishermen in the North Sea have been much in the news this week. The disclosure that each week our prawn fishermen dump 60% of their catches back into the sea (dead, of course) because they are illegally-caught cod has been described as &amp;quot;obscene&amp;quot; by the EU Fisheries Commissioner, and rightly so. According to Jonathan Shaw, the UK Fisheries Minister, this shows that we need to increase the UK's cod quota so that these perfectly good fish can be landed and sold rather than being dumped. The fishermen, meanwhile, will have none of it, and insist that the whole quota system needs to be scrapped.

OK, run that past me again. There is a quota system because the over-fishing of the North Sea by (among others) the British has led to a dangerous depletion of cod stocks. The quotas are intended to reduce the killing of cod. So, OK, British fisherman are illegally killing millions of cod. Now, children, is the solution:

(a) get them to kill fewer cod?
(b) let them kill the same number of cod but pay them more money to do so?
(c) let them kill as many cod as they like until cod are are just an old person's memory?

If you answered (a), you have a working brain but clearly don't live in the crazy world of our fishing industry and its parliamentary puppets.

If you answered (b) or (c) piss off now and go and do the lottery or something more appropriate to your powers of thought, like emailing your bank details to Nigeria.

If the point of quotas is to conserve fish stocks, then the solution is to catch fewer cod . (Duh.)

But wait! say the bottom-feeders. We can't tell cod from the prawns we're trying to catch, and (wow!) they end up in the nets anyway. Hah! We win!

Well, Einstein(s), it's maybe about time our fishing fleet invested in some on-board salt water tanks like the ones they use in the Far East to bring their (smallish) catches in alive for their demanding diners. Then the illegally-netted cod could be dumped back alive and the prawns brought home. Or, they could use creels rather than nets to catch their prawns, or more modern designs of net, as suggested by the International Council for the Exploration of Species. Alternatively, our seaborne Sherlocks could try for a career more suited to their abilities, such as asking &amp;quot;Do you want fries with that?&amp;quot; when handling fish caught legally by some other country's fleet.

I'm suffering an Ohrwurm . (But not this kind .)

A couple of weeks ago, the Sunday Times had free copies of the new Ray Davies CD Working Man's Cafe , so I bought a paper to get the CD. The Sunday Times was the same old Europhobic nonsense, but the CD was very good. (I gather the non-freebie version has two more tracks; mine ends with Voodoo Walk .) One track in particular stands out for me, and I keep finding myself humming it: One More Time . It has to be his best melody since Waterloo Sunset, and the lyrics are terrific as well. OK, so its middle eight is businesslike rather than inspired, but I reckon it's a fine piece of work and deserves to be played frequently. What do other people think?

San Francisco Symphony Orchestra / Michael Tilson Thomas, Usher Hall 29 August 2007
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<POST>
<POSTER> sted by Rob @ </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> 2007-09-01T14:20:00 </POSTDATE>
I was looking forward to this concert for several reasons. I'd never seen Tilson Thomas before, though I have a lot of his recordings. I'd never heard John Adams' A Short Ride In A Fast Machine live. Tchaikovsky's First Symphony is one of my favourites. Oh, and they were doing Copland's Fanfare For The Common Man as well.

It didn't disappoint. MTT, rather to my surprise, is a fairly undemonstrative conductor (I'd rather expected a Bernsteinish adrenaline junkie) who can get impressive results with a small twitch of his baton. One of those conductors who uses his right hand for most things and would be minimally inconvenienced by having his left arm in a sling.

The first three pieces on the programme used different sections of the orchestra, so he grouped them together and took applause after the last one. First there was the Copland, beautifully played and with terrific crashes from the percussion (the timps were up on a platform which added to the resonance). Next, a rarity: the Andante For Strings by Ruth Crawford Seeger, arranged from her 1931 string quartet. Ruth Crawford Seeger turns out to have been the mother of Mike and Peggy, and the stepmother of Pete. Although she displayed very great talent early on, it was her marriage to Charles Seeger that brought her compositional career to an early end, not because of any sexism on his part, but because of his obsessive interest in traditional music of various kinds. He firmly believed that folk and ethnic music was of far more significance than art music, and Ruth simply went along with the project, changing from a composer to a collector and transcriber. The author of the programme note considers her to have been on a par with Sessions and Copland as a composer. On the basis of this single movement I would say that was an exaggeration, though the piece certainly wasn't devoid of interest, nor does it sound very dated.

Finally in this group we had the John Adams. Short Ride is described as a &amp;quot;Fanfare For Orchestra&amp;quot;, and is certainly a popular showpiece. It starts with an &amp;quot;almost sadistic&amp;quot; metronomic tapping on a woodblock, with the rest of the orchestra gradually getting stuck in until the place is shaking. John Adams explains the piece thus: &amp;quot;You know how it is when someone asks you to ride in a terrific sports car, and then you wish you hadn't?&amp;quot; There is certainly a feeling of clinging in terror to one's seat as the orchestra really gets wound up. (If you've never heard the piece, give it a whirl some time.) Anyway, the SFSO obviously enjoyed themselves, and MTT (who had given the piece its first performance 21 years ago) was in his element, controlling the deceptively complex cross-rhythms with his businesslike little strokes, interlaced with the odd horizontal sweep around 180 degrees when he really wanted to make a point.

Following a last-minute entrance by one of the horn players (who had maybe got lost backstage like Spinal Tap, and who came on to a cheer from the audience to which he returned a &amp;quot;what can you do?&amp;quot; shrug) the first half closed with Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto, flamboyantly played (it's that kind of piece) by Yefim Bronfman. The solo part is hugely difficult, and like so much Prokofiev the piece is a mix of the clever and the tuneful. Not one of my favourite concertos, but this performance just about had me converted.

Tchaikovsky's First Symphony &amp;quot;Winter Daydreams&amp;quot; ought to be far more popular than it is. Very Russian-sounding, very beautiful, very evocative. Actually, all the Tchaikovsky symphonies are worth hearing: there aren't any duds, which is more than you can say for Schubert, Mendelssohn, Dvorak or even Mozart or Bruckner. Beethoven, Brahms and Mahler manage the trick as well, so he's in good company. It was interesting to hear MTT, whom I knew as an interpreter of American music and twentieth century music, doing core Romantic repertoire. He certainly coaxed some stunningly beautiful playing from the orchestra, whose woodwind and horns in particular took full advantage of the lovely stuff Tchaikovsky wrote for them. (There is a wonderful big tune for the massed horns in the slow movement, for example.)

All through the symphony I'd been wondering why there was a harp on stage, as it hadn't been played all evening. When I saw a harpist and three or four wind players slipping on during the appluase after the symphony, it became clear that an encore was about to occur; and it did. Bernstein's Candide overture was given the full Monty (or the full Lenny) and we all left smiling (and humming one of the twentieth century's more memorable tunes: DUM, diddle-iddle-iddle-um dum, DUM, diddle-iddle-iddle-dum, DUM, diddle-iddle-iddle-um dum, Dum dum de-iddle-iddle-iddle dum.......)

The recent BBC Panorama programme on the use of child labour in the manufacture of clothing by High Street store Primark 's suppliers undoubtedly uncovered abuse and hypocrisy. Still, it awoke in me the same nagging, insistent thought that discussion of child labour (or indeed exploitative employment of adults) in the developing world usually does. Then it fell to The Daily Mash , as latter-day court jesters, to think the unthinkable and put the same misgivings online. While making them funny, of course.

But as with mediaeval jesters, the laughter is perhaps a little uncomfortable when they stray too close to the truth for comfort.

quite

there was a rather amusing series on the bbc a little while back, taking a bunch of fashion-conscious brit kids and dropping them into different parts of the Indian clothing-production "food-chain"

lots of predictable tears and fashionable hand-wringing over the INIQUITY of their pay-rates and their lifestyles.

and then they talked to the subjects, rather than opining about them.

...
each and every single one (with the exception of the cottonpickers) said they were angry with the brits for trying to f*ck up the best job they'd ever had and the first real chance they'd ever had to dig themselves and their family out of the grinding poverty trap they'd been in before.

i'm deeply unhappy about the macro inequalities and the domestic injustices which lead to these people having no better choices.

but i'm deeply angered by the irresponsible arrogance of twonkers living in dreamland coming in, screwing things up by artificially and inappropriately imposing standards utterly dissociated from the realities of a wildly different situation than their fantasies insist, then drifting off back to dreamland.

I can't imagine what it would take to get Sir Ian Blair (and I bet the government is regretting that knighthood now) to resign. In the matter of the shooting of Jean Charles Menezes, the court has ruled that the entire Metropolitan Police Force is guilty of homicide. Once upon a time we had public officials - including senor police officers - who understood the concept of responsibility. The Met right now has a head who understands only his salary and his pension: a pig, as it were, with his snout in the trough.

A good report here . I especially liked &amp;quot;We may well be short of many categories of copper - armed response guys who know anything about bombs, surveillance guys who can tell one olive-skinned bloke from another, officers at any level who are willing to do the right thing without being told to. We aren't short of senior police bureaucrats with apparently invulnerable political connections. We could spare one of them.&amp;quot;

And to stop you weeping for the lost ideal of public accountability, here is a funnier (if extremely irreverent) take on the proceedings.

I've just been listening (courtesy of the BBC's &amp;quot;Listen Again&amp;quot; facility) to tonight's episode of Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency . It contained a line (as does the book) describing Sir Isaac Newton as the inventor of the cat-flap. I'd always taken this to be Adamsian rhetorical excess, but a little Googling suggests that in fact the great man did invent the cat-flap. At least, the Science Museum seem to believe he did, and as a child I was so knocked out by my first visit (aged 10) to the SM with an aunt that I went back twice alone in the next week. This confirmed me in my love of (a) science (b) pottering around museums by myself. I have retained both.

One of the things that blew my ten-year-old mind was the Foucault pendulum: seeing actual proof that the Earth had turned while I was in the museum just knocked my socks off. I've seen a similar one in the Louvre. There's also one in the Manchester student residence (near the Renold Building) where I have stayed twice for health &amp;amp; safety conferences. This last one, however, obstinately fails to rotate relative to the building, meaning either that the planet ceases to rotate during Hazards conferences, or that the pendulum's pivot is fucked (and that the building maintenance people have no understanding - despite all the signage - of what it's supposed to do).

My own student residence was a 1960s block, but our college (University College, Durham) was based in a medieval castle, and I ate all my meals in college in its medieval great hall (not unlike the Hogwarts one in the Harry Potter films). Unlike Dirk Gently, my college tutor (Gerald Brooke) lived out of college, in the village of Shincliffe. He was, however, just as eccentric as Prof. Chronotis, as I discovered when he interviewed me. I drew his attention to an envelope on the floor and was told &amp;quot;Oh, I always leave letters on the floor - it reminds me to post them&amp;quot;. The logic is impeccable (and in fact as a student I adopted exactly that system for things I needed to post) but it's definitely unusual.

Which brings us (I suppose) by a commodius vicus of recirculation, by swerve of shore and bend of bay, back to Dirk Gently and environs.....

Well, there I was, all set to listen to the last episode of Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency , and what do I find? After a mere eight days, it's been removed from the &amp;quot;Listen Again&amp;quot; feature. On the other hand, I can buy a three CD set of the series, or listen to a trailer for the next series. How nice.

Fortunately:

1. I can read, so I already know how the series ends
2. I can read, so I already know the second book is crap
3. I can tell the BBC what they can do with their CDs, and with the second series

Customer service? Ha! We laugh at customer service. They probably needed the bandwidth for the 18th re-run of French and Bloody Saunders.

Catch me relying on the website to listen to anything in future? Nope. BBC comedy just shot itself in the foot. Again.

The trouble is, they're not even that consistent. Sometimes when a series is running they have all the previous episdes available, sometimes only the last one. (Or maybe that's changed now?) And cetrtainly you can get hold of one-off programmes several weeks later (or not at all). The policy seems to vary between stations as well. Pah!

A story that makes me angry , courtesy of Ally Fogg (thanks to Clare for drawing my attention to it).

Looking for an update on Karen's situation, I found this , this and this . All of which goes to show that Sheila Foley's £135,000 salary is unmatched by any kind of people management skills. Also, that Karen is getting a lot of support, and that there are still some unrepentant union-bashers out there, to say nothing of some people clearly living in a parallel universe ( gjh again says..&amp;quot; and if I hear another nurse say she is over worked and under paid....it's a healthy salary &amp;amp; just get another job if your not happy.&amp;quot; )(sic).

Here is Karen's campaign's site, where you can read, among other things, the original interview that got her fired. I have to say it seems pretty mild stuff to me. As a union rep, I'd certainly take care what I said about my employer but expressing concern about privatisation doesn't seem excessive to me. She didn't make comments about individuals and as far as I can tell didn't let slip any confidential details (which clearly would be a no-no, for example if the union had been told something under embargo). Even if it was felt she was out of line, there is no way the article could be said to &amp;quot;bring the Trust into disrepute&amp;quot;. Unlike Sheila Foley's incompetent flailing about, which is simply making it a laughing-stock.

I was sent this by a friend, and it seemed worth sharing with you all. You don't have to be Canadian to sign the petition (though no doubt if you are it will be even more effective). Having sat through a number of sessions at Health &amp;amp; Safety conferences on the extremely unpleasant effects of mesothelioma I have no hesitation in endorsing the call, even if it is from a website called RightOnCanada.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

ASBESTOS—A KNOWN KILLER

Asbestos is a known killer and a leading cause of workers' deaths in Canada and around the world.

Most developed countries, including the European Union, have banned asbestos. The World Health Organization (WHO), the International Labour Organization, the Canadian Cancer Society and other respected organizations have called for a ban on all forms of asbestos. But instead of banning asbestos, the Canadian government uses tax-payers dollars and Canadian embassies to actively promote the sale of asbestos around the world.

Over 90% of Canada's asbestos goes to developing countries, where worker protections are weak or non-existent.

The Canadian government pushes the spin of the asbestos industry that chrysotile asbestos can somehow be safely handled. Medical experts and knowledgeable organizations, such as the WHO, disagree. And as the government knows full well, safety protections are usually non-existent in developing countries.

Quebec, home to most of Canada's asbestos mines, has one of the highest rates of mesothelioma (a deadly cancer caused by asbestos) on the planet. Yet the Canadian government refuses to even keep track of the growing numbers of Canadian workers who are sick and dying from asbestos-caused cancer.

And internationally Canada is acting as a scoundrel. Canada has been severely criticized for preventing the listing of chrysotile asbestos as a hazardous product under the Rotterdam Convention, an International Agreement that requires that importing countries be warned of the risks associated with hazardous products.

Please send your letter to Stephen Harper at RightOnCanada.ca .

&amp;quot;It is unconscionable that Canada knowingly exports a product that will kill thousands of people in Asia, Africa and South America,&amp;quot; says David R. Boyd of the David Suzuki Foundation.

It's time, says health expert, Barry Castleman, for Canada &amp;quot;to join the rest of the civilized countries of this world in shutting down the asbestos industry.&amp;quot;

The next meeting of the Parties to the Rotterdam Convention takes place in Rome in October 2008.

LETS GET OUR GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE ITS POSITION AND BAN ASBESTOS BEFORE THEN.

TOGETHER WE CAN DO IT!

Please tell Prime Minister Harper to ban asbestos now, before more unnecessary deaths are caused. Tell him to put the lives of people ahead of the profits of the asbestos industry.

John Reid excelled himself at talking fascistic nonsense about a subject (human rights) on which he knows nothing whatsoever. (Though he did also announce that at the next election he would stand down as a MP, which must surely be an excuse for a commemorative public holiday?)

Sir Menzies Campbell attempted to reinvent the Liberal Democrats as a Eurosceptic party.

Gordon Brown reassured us all that Blair's Thatcherite legacy would be well looked after.

Israel's government , suffering serious withdrawal problems after several months during which it hadn't launched an unprovoked attack on a single neighbouring country, put the smile back on its collective face by committing a war crime (just a little one) in Syria. (&amp;quot;The security services and Israeli defence forces are demonstrating unusual courage&amp;quot; - Ehud Olmert. Committing cowardly murders in peacetime in a neighbour's sovereign territory is hardly courageous; nor, of course, is it unusual.)

Britain's biggest arms fair hosted sellers of leg irons and shoulder-launched cluster bombs (though the former were expelled after they were exposed).

Saudi Arabia &amp;quot;made itself party to the kidnapping of a Pakistani citizen in broad daylight and has flouted international law&amp;quot; (Human Rights Watch), not that any of that greatly concerned the soi-disant warriors on terror in London or Washington, though the EU - to its considerable credit - did protest.

Pretty normal week really.

Well, this isn't good news. Nevertheless, the USA and UK continue to support the nuclear-armed Taleban-backing dictator while planning the destruction of non-nuclear-armed Iran whose leader is selected by (admittedly probably rigged) elections rather than military coup.

Strolling Theatricals - &quot;Bouncy Castle Macbeth&quot; - 14 August 2007

This, surely, is one of those shows that one could only get in the Edinburgh Fringe. A cut-down (but otherwise hardly modified) version of Macbeth played entirely on a bouncy castle? It has advantages. I mean, how often do you see Lady Macbeth actually turn a back somersault with joy at reading her husband's letter in Act One?

Particular pleasures:

&amp;quot;Thou sure and firm-set earth (bounce, bounce...)&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;...a poor player that struts and fret and bounces his hour upon the stage....&amp;quot;

Knowing what was coming during Macbeth's pre-murder monologue as a giant inflatable banana appeared over the battlements: &amp;quot;Is this a dagger that I see before me...&amp;quot;

Duncan's being battered to death by a gigantic ketchup-stained banana.

Some wonderful Coarse Acting , esp. from Duncan.

The dinner scene (appearance of Banquo's ghost), in which we have the pleasure of three couples doing a kind of Scottish Country Dancing (on a bouncy castle).

&amp;quot;They have tied me to a stake, I cannot fly&amp;quot; voiced by Macbeth with an inflatable beefsteak strapped to his head.

An inflatable Banquo, whose progeny are represnted in Act IV sc. 1 by a family album.

In their own words ....

Oh, go and see it. The only bad review I've read was from someone who had no previous knowledge of Macbeth at all, which might - I suppose - alter your expectations a bit. (The giant banana is, after, funny only if one is expecting a dagger.) Worthy of your support, people of Edinburgh.

I look forward to next year (variously suggested as King Lear or Oedipus Rex).

I've always taken an interest in those &amp;quot;things everyone knows&amp;quot; which then turn out to be urban myths. For example, not long ago I was about to make a reference to the paediatrician who was forced from her home by an angry mob who confused the word with &amp;quot;paedophile&amp;quot;, when I thought I'd check it. Here 's an example of the original story, and here is a good survey of the ways it's been embellished.

So this article in Scientific American (August 2007 in the print edition) grabbed my attention at once.

I'm not sure whether the bit I liked best was the reasons pencils wouldn't have been a good choice, or the fact that the USSR ordered the same pens for use on Soyuz.

I was a subscriber to the CN in its last days, which is a badge I wear with pride. Having come to The Children's Encylopedia late in life, I think of Mee as the author of the somewhat similar Book Of Ten Thousand Things , which made me what I am today. (Fact-worshipping polymath?

I was amused to notice this week that the strange person from Ankara who found EKN via a search for &amp;quot;turbaned p*rno&amp;quot; has reappeared. I suspect it is the same person, as the request again originated from Turkey (this time from Diyarbakir).

In case you were wondering, while the exact phrase occurs only in the post linked above, an &amp;quot;all the words&amp;quot; search also brings up this , which is clearly what drew the guy in. Though I doubt it was what he was after....

As a result of taking part in a meme over on LiveJournal, I was reading what various people had been doing last Guy Fawkes' Night (November 5th to you non-Brits). It seems quite a few were watching a TV programme in which Richard Hammond (best known as one of the presenters of the BBC motoring programme Top Gear) set out to reconstruct Fawkes's 1605 attempt to demolish Parliament , with the significant difference that he set his explosion off. He was doing it in a military bombing range, using a full-size reconstruction of the original builiding and 18 cwt. of gunpowder. Oh, and a lot of crash test dummies.

If you would like to know how big the bang was, how much damage the building sustained, how big the one part of the royal dummy(James VI to the Scots, James I to the English) was which was located afterwards, and how far it went, watch this video . It comes in 8 parts (the others are on the same page of Youtube) and lasts about an hour.

There is a certain addictive quality to watching a building being picked up and shaken in slow motion....... If you want to skip to that, it's in part 7. But it's a good programme and worth watching in full.

He is Lawrence Dunn, leader of Edinburgh Light Orchestra (whose conductor James Beyer is the other chap in the picture). In fact they were both photoghaphed at an Edinburgh Symphony Orchestra concert at the National Museum of Scotland back in the summer, when James was guesting as our conductor and Lawrence was adding ot our viola section. A little Googling provided this:

LAWRENCE DUNN studied violin with David Hume in Edinburgh and Malcolm Layfield in Manchester. He gives regular solo and chamber recitals during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and throughout Scotland on both modern and baroque instruments. As a freelance player he has performed with various orchestras including the Scottish Baroque Players, Newcastle Baroque and the City of Glasgow Symphony Orchestra. He is a member of Quernstane, Edinburgh Barock and Edinburgh Galante, and has recently taken over as leader of the Edinburgh Light Orchestra and the Edinburgh Palm Court Orchestra.

In a prevuious existence he also worked for the Bank of Scotland as a computer programmer, which fact I know (a) because I sit next to one of his sometime colleagues and (b) because one ogf the big old Assembler progams which I look after has his name running though parts of it in the comments like the lettering in a stick of rock. It's hard to look at Lawrence now and think &amp;quot;bank worker&amp;quot;, but there you go.

The original as I know it is from Pliny the Elder in his Natural History, &amp;quot;Ex africa semper aliquid novi&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;there's always something new out of Africa&amp;quot;. (Isak Dinesen used it for the title of a book, later filmed with Meryl Streep and Robert Redford.)

Checking on the web it would seem that the saying was around before Pliny: see here .

Anyway, that's what I had in mind.

If your query was purely grammatical, then (a) take it up with Mr Pliny - it's his language, not mine - and (b) read section (e) of this .

To Gartnavel Royal Hospital in Glasgow last Wednesday for a "Gamelan Taster Workshop". Actually first I went to Gartnaval Hospital, which is next door and connected, but not so connected that the building I was looking for appeared on any maps at the latter. Nor did the first staff member I asked know where it was, though he helpfully told me someone else had just asked, so by looking for somebody with a lost and confused air I joined up with Kate and we eventually found it together.

The workshop was run by Signy Jakobsdottir from Gamelan Naga Mas . She started out by explaining about Indonesian gamelan music, telling us that the instruments we had we from Java and had been commissioned by Strathclyde Regional Council back when Glasgow was European City of Culture. There are two kinds of gamelan, based on the two Indonesian musical scales pelog and slendro . Both kinds were commissioned, but for some reason they have always been kept apart rather than being combined as they would normally be in Java. The pelog instrument lives at Gartnaval and is used by Naga Mas (also for music therapy with dementia patients) while the slendro set is in East Kilbride, forty-odd miles away, where it's also used for therapy.

Anyway, we learned about the different instruments, how to strike them and what roles the played in the ensemble. Then we tried them out. We learned played three or four short pieces, and rotated around so that anyone who wished to could have a go on everything. I can't remember the Javanese names, but there were big cup-shaped hanging gongs, elegant and slightly domed bronze chime bar sets, rather lighter tinny metal bars with big wooden or plastic resonators underneath, horizontal arrays of little gongs (which is what I always visualised when I pictured a gamelan), and a big double-ended hand-drum with which Signy led us. It was all terrific fun and I was sorry when the two hours were up.

Naga Mas are always on the lookout for new members, and if I lived in Glasgow I wouldn't have hesitated (one night a week for rehearsing). But as I live in Edinburgh and have another regular musical commitemnt as well as a full-time job, that will have to wait until I retire.

A column of Phil's from way back when, which he reposted recently and which made me laugh. Even if the second problem makes the totally unrealistic assumption that Acme management would give a toss what the IT director (merely a rude mechanical, after all) thought when it came to imposing their corporate will on the infrastructure. I once worked in a place where a manager (S) was severely reprimanded for pointing out that a piece of kit the company were considering simply wouldn't do the job it was being bought for. The sales manager of the vendor had stormed into S's senior management and complained &amp;quot;S needs to be reminded that this isn't how we do things&amp;quot;. (I'm sure the quality of their corporate golf days was excellent, though.)

Re operators and why they should not be crossed, I enjoy dipping into Bastard Operator From Hell from time to time. (In the interest of your sanity, I should explain that PFY stands for Pale-Faced Youth, who is a regular character.)

At around 17.00 on Thursday, Elizabeth I and II (*) overtook her great-grandmother Victoria to become the oldest monarch every to sit on a British throne. Still a few years to go before she's reigned as long as Vicky though (who was impossibly young when she succeeded).

A lovely story (maybe apocryphal but probably not) is that her mother (also Queen Elizabeth) was on the royal yacht Britannia when cocktail hour came around. She rang down to the stewards and said &amp;quot;I don't know what you old queens are doing, but this old queen would like a gin and tonic&amp;quot;.

* As they say in Scotland.

As a follow-up to this post , I can't refrain from mentioning this wonderful story to which Hilary drew my attention.

Mid-air altercations leading to staff getting injured? Blimey. I blame this opera nonsense meself: all these long-haired Florentine layabouts like Claudio Maharishi, and their new-fangled music. It won't last.....

One assumes that any stories of Jordi Savall throwing TV sets out of a window of the Balmoral Hotel, or snorting cocaine through rolled-up pages of L'Incoronazione di Poppea , will be kept out of the papers. *

Anyway, here is a picture of Jordi, perhaps just before settting his viola da gamba alight during a performance of Playford's La Cloche ....

And here's someone who saw the same performance of Orfeo as me and liked it slightly less musically; but who also saw Jordi's solo viola da gamba recital which I hadn't booked for, and loved it. Damn.

* I was present at a piano rehearsal for Mike Nunn's 1974 student production of Poppea when someone or other knocked a gin and tonic (with the gin dominant, of course...ta-da!) over what was at the time the only copy (I believe) of the score of the Raymond Leppard edition. Fortunately, Leppard's ink rose to the occasion (Mike commenting that it probably wasn't the first inundation it had had, musicians being what they are....).

Having mentioned in my last post a gig I was gutted to miss because I was on holiday, here 's one I was gutted to miss by being in Manchester either the week before or the one after, I forget which. Indeed, gutted doesn't begin to describe it: Joseph Byrd has been one of my musical heroes since my teens. It was his second album which I ordered from Virgin, thus obtaining the wonderful postcard I described.

Here is an interview with him.

And for all that Judith Weiss and I are no longer on (polite) blogging terms, let me take this opportunity to point out that what originally made me pay her more attention than your run-of-the-mill rent-a-Zionist was her liking for Joseph Byrd (and, as I would find out, Richard Thompson, Martin Carthy, the Watersons and Judy Henske). OK, so she turned out to be evil, but as she cheers on the coming nuclear holocaust at least she'll be doing it to a decent soundtrack. Judith described our relationship somewhere as (I paraphrase slightly) having no common ground politically but being musical soulmates. Can't argue with that, though I could say just the same of Adolf Hitler. And as someone for whom music is probably the most important part of my life, if she were to turn up in Edinburgh I might still be prepared to buy her a drink for the fun of talking music, despite all the unpleasantness. I've done concerts with people I disliked far more than Judith, after all. It would be interesting to see whether under the circumstances she would be prepared to have a drink with me. (On the one hand, embodiment of evil. On the other, someone who knows the words to &amp;quot;Winifer Odd&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dragging The River&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The American Metaphysical Circus&amp;quot;. Tough call, I suspect.)

In our household, we don't watch Dinner For One every year.

We don't even watch It's A Wonderful Life each Christmas (just sometimes).

Our children (now 19 and 15!) still watch A Muppet Christmas Carol each year (it was a favourite of their late grandfather, and they borrow the video from their grandmother).

Hilary and Vanessa and I, though, do watch the Christmas episode from Season One of The West Wing each year. Not sure about Hilary, but it generally causes tears in Vanessa and me. Not so much that I can't appreciate one of the finest pieces of editing (for the funeral scene) that I've ever watched.

If you watch this clip you get the basic plotline, albeit with dreadful sound. I suggest that just after the President pats Toby on the shoulder, and before Toby heads off to the funeral, you switch to this clip with better sound (pretend you don't notice the semitone shift upwards!).

Oh, and the significance of the lady who says &amp;quot;Toby..I'd like to come along&amp;quot; is that her twin sons were killed in Vietnam on 24/12/1970.

A peaceful and happy Christmas to you all.

I think you've just decided for me what we'll be watching tonight (after Skyping the rellies in NZ).

I may even top it off with Noel from S2 with the Bach just to completely have me sobbing.

PS went to see Its a Wonderful Life at the flicks last night: the audience spontaneously clapped and cheered at the end. Sniff!

Following on from the review of the Simon Bolivar YO concert, here are a few interesting and related posts from a blog I've just found: On An Overgrown Path .

First, this .

Then this follow-up .

And then returning to Venezuela, this .

You know the trouble with blogs like On An Overgrown Path ? I'm going to spend so much time reading all its archives that I don't get round to reading stuff by people I know and who visit me. Bah.

While we're here, though, a couple of other ace posts. (I shall be looking out for Mr McFall's Chamber in the future.)

Chamber Orchestra of Europe - Usher Hall - 13 August 2007

A disappointing turnout (the Usher Hall about 60% full) for what was in fact a really good concert of Beethoven, Stravinsky, Adès and Sibelius conducted by Thomas Adès. We began with an rarity: Beethoven's Namensfeier overture Op.115. The programme note reckoned that for people to criticise it as not being as good as, say, Egmont is like criticising The Winter's Tale for not being King Lear . Probably fair enough: it's an interesting piece, I'm glad I heard it, and I would be happy enough to hear it again. However, there's nothing especially memorable about it.

Stravinsky's Pulcinella suite, on the other hand, has lots of hummable tunes, all of them written by Pergolesi whose music Stravinsky arranged (perhaps reinvented would be better) for the piece. As Edinburgh Symphony Orchestra are doing this one next summer I was paying close attention, so I can report that the COE players acquitted themselves brilliantly (there are a lot of solos, including one for double bass). Adès gave them all plenty of space and they clearly enjoyed themselves.

After the inteval we had Thomas Adès's violin concerto Concentric Paths , played by Anthony Marwood. As far as I know I'd never heard any of Adès's music before (though anyone who could come up with a title like These Premises Are Alarmed seemed worth a listen). It was interesting stuff, and I shall probably try to listen to it again if it's broadcast. It was quirky without being unapproachably weird, and did have some nice sounds in there. The last movement in particular fairly rocked along, and I can imagine that in due course it will take its place in the modern concertio repertoire. (To date all its performances have been played by Marwood and conducted by Adès.) I also hadn't heard of Anthony Marwood before, and while this wasn't a piece that gave too much of a clue as to what he'd be like playing other repertoire, he certainly didn't seem bothered by its technical demands. Neither did the orchestra, who rose to every challenge, with some very fine brass playing in particular.

Finally we came to Sibelius's Third Symphony, a great piece (though probably the one of the seven Sibelius symphonies I know least well). This is Sibelius beginning the journey down the rabbit-hole away from the overt romanticism of his early works and towards the compressed style of the later ones. Strange and very beautiful, and the COE gave it all they had, with some wonderful playing all round.

Perhaps not an obviously crowd-pleasing programme - hence the poor audience numbers - but the crowd that was there were evidently well pleased by it.

Nothing wrong with that, Joe. We're not really any different from New York or San Francisco in the level of &amp;quot;culture&amp;quot;: we just pack a heck of a lot of it into three weeks each summer.And not everything in the Edinburgh Festivals is &amp;quot;culture&amp;quot;. The Bouncy Castle Macbeth ? Come on...fun, yes, culture, hardly.

And I am looking forward quite immoderately to seeing Alice Cooper in a few months' time (and unlike Elvis, it's still the real one). And my wife saw Elton John again a few weeks ago (I skipped that one, but we both saw him a couple of years back).

I wonder if Vegas has an amateur orchestral subculture (hobbyists like me)? Edinburgh is unusually rich in that area, even compared with London, but I wouldn't be surprised to find something in LV.

After the women came home, I did two things. The most recent (while blogging, in fact) was to knock out a tooth filling on a spicy green pea (mild ouch). The earlier, courtesy of a late night showing at our local arthouse cinema, was to see Hallam Foe . This time Hilary and Vanessa had seen it before me, and had reported well of it, so I was puzzled when I spent the first 15-20 minutes finding the plot and characters so unbelievable that I wondered if I was going to get through the film without walking out. I'm glad I persisted, though, as after about 20 minutes it picked up (about the point where Hallam goes to Edinburgh). As the girls said, it's rather nice to watch a film and know all the locations, and from there on I did. Jamie Bell was excellent in the title role, showing that there is life beyond Billy Elliott, while Sophie Myles acted her socks - and other things - off as his girlfriend (and is surely now destined to hoover up many of the roles which used to go to Kate Winslet) . It was strange, though perhaps it shouldn't have been, that the minor characters were less well acted (not wooden, just less well-defined) with the glorious exceptions of those played by Ewan Bremner and Maurice Roeves. It just shows that they are famous actors for a reason . Good credits, great soundtrack. Not my film of the year, but I very much enjoyed it.

I was interested to read recently about Google's plans for the future. They're interested in collecting a lot of personal data, which is rather scary, but what they have in mind for it is like a sort of amplified version of what Amazon do. You know, &amp;quot;People who bought Madonna's Confessions On A Dance Floor also bought Frederick Rzewski's Variations on The People United Will Never Be Defeated &amp;quot; . (OK, maybe that's just me.) So if you keyed in a search they could for example order the results according to your perceived priorities. An interesting idea, though fraught with practical difficulties, methinks. Not least that if you take it to its logical conclusion you get fewer surprises when Googling, and they're half the fun.

The idea I really took to, though, was for supermarkets. Since their stock locations are already held on computer, why not make this available, for example to mobile phones. So instead of standing in Waitrose scratching your head wondering where the hell the capers are located, or whether they in fact have any 40% strength gin, you'd download the store shelf map. If that's the future, I want to live there.

A few observations on this story which you probably saw in the news last week:

1) I have every sympathy with the kid. Having an unusual name, especially one which has clearly been inflicted on you as pure parental whim rather than period fashion (in which I include the Kylies, Madonnas, etc.) or family tradition.

2) As the comments on the BBC site make clear, some kids thrive on the attention generated by an odd name, while some hate it. My name is boring and conventional, but at primary school I still retained my parents' Dorset accent (this in North Manchester) so was forever being picked on, bundled off to a corner of the playground and surrounded by kids demanding that I say something. What else could I do but become a comedian? (Not professionally, but as the class comic through the rest of my schooldays.) If my unwanted attention had stemmed from my name I expect the result would have been similar.

3) Even when parents aren't trying to be wacky in their choice of names it's easy to forget something. One of my father's brothers was named Alfred Stanley Saunders, which generated unfortunate initials. A good friend of mine, Chris Eyre, was known as "ozone" at school (C Eyre = sea air).

4) She is very definitely not alone, as a casual perusal of Remarkable Names Of Real People demonstrates. Funnily enough the Rev. Canaan Banana (an entry in the book) came up in a family conversation recently on the topic of the Zimbabwean elections.

5) Frank Zappa's children have famously wacky names: Moon Unit, Dweezil, Ahmet and Diva. However, one thing I didn't know until researching this post is that

Dweezil's registered birth name was Ian Donald Calvin Euclid Zappa, although this occurred only because the hospital at which he was born refused to register him under the name Dweezil. The name was a nickname coined by Frank for an oddly-curled pinky-toe of Gail's. He was always called "Dweezil" by his family and was unaware that this was not the name on his birth certificate. Upon this discovery at the age of five, he insisted on having his nickname become his legal name. Gail and Frank hired an attorney and soon the name Dweezil was official. (from Wikipedia entry for Dweezil Zappa)

6) Let's give Frank Zappa the last word:

People make a lot of fuss about my kids having such supposedly 'strange names', but the fact is that no matter what first names I might have given them, it is the last name that is going to get them in trouble.

This was a two-man show by Henning Wehn (German Comedy Ambassador to the UK) and Otto Kuhnle (the Funniest Man in Dusseldorf). As to content, it was a brief illustrated lecture, firstly on what German humour is not (stand-up, self-deprecation, sausage crime)(which is selling crap sausages at inflated prices) and then what it is (folk music, gnomes, punctuality, yodelling, Ostis)(that's ex-East Germans). It was in fact very funny, though the quality ranged from uttely hilarious to merely quite funny. The highlights for me were the illustrated version of Auf der Schwäbischen Eisenbahn , which added a number of jokes about obsessive punctuality; Otto's version of the Birdcatcher's Song from The Magic Flute , complete with frantically flapping mechanical bird, and Otto's home-made B&amp;amp;Q; Alphorn. There were of course jokes about the English, especially football fans ('They have this chant: Two World Wars and one World Cup, which I think is strange because, as far as I know, the United States has never won a World Cup&amp;quot;). The wars (both) get a mention, of course: Henning expressed happiness that Germany had lost the 1914-18 war because that meant it lost all its colonial possessions; which in turn meant that practically nobody outside Germany speaks German; which means that when he phones his bank the call centre is going to be no more than a few hundred kilometres away (though if he's unlucky it might be in the old East....) You have to take off your hat (oh, another thing that German humour is: the hat trick. I suppose you had to be there....) to anyone who can get most of an Edinburgh audience yodelling. And who can joke about Prince William supporting Aston Villa &amp;quot;when he should be supporting his local team.......Hannover&amp;quot;.

Worth seeing, but book early: Hilary and Vanessa tried last night to get tickets for tonight and couldn't (so they went to see the new Shah Rukh Khan film* instead). On until Sunday.

* Chak De India , in which there is music but no dancing, and in which SRK never actually cries, though his eyes spend much of the film being rather moist. What is Bollywood coming to?

It was refreshing, and unexpected, to be able to buy a newspaper in Ullapool last week, on September 11th, and to find not a single reference to the 2001 attacks.

Instead there was this interesting story.

On the down side, it was only today, via linkbunnies.org again, that I discovered Joe Zawinul died on 11 September.

It seems rather fitting to be responding to someone who accused me of being an anti-Semitic fascist during a weekend when I'm mostly occupied with playing Wagner. And not just Wagner, but Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg , in which the butt of the jokes is Sixtus Beckmesser, who is considered by some critics to be a caricatured Jew.

However, let's remember that before Sachs (surely one of the nicest characters in opera) goes on about Holy German Art at the very end, he has a much more famous song (the Wahnmonolog ) in which he bemoans the omnipresence of violence in human society, and wonders how all this &amp;quot;power of the Dark Side&amp;quot; can be turned to good.

And let's also remember that in the process of taking the piss out of Beckmesser's incompetent plagiarism, Wagner - so far as I can tell - invented the use of deliberate Mondegreens as a humorous device.

Over on LiveJournal, a guy I shared a house with as a student (and who must at the very least share the blame for getting me interested in computers) posted the following in response to my recent Harry Potter-related post :

Subject: fan fics for non fac fic people
Not sure how to categorize this . But it appeals to those of you who are not hard core HP fans. or at least, not obsessed.

I would describe myself as an HP fan though not obsessed (I leave that to my daughter). I enjoyed it a lot (especially Prof. McGonagall's email to Harry).

I suppose the question now is, why would those who ARE obsessive HP fans not enjoy it? Because I bet my daughter would. OK, maybe there are degrees of obsession, but surely taking something seriously doesn't necessarily involve a sense of humour bypass? For example, the famous Chuck Jones cartoon What's Opera, Doc? is not only full of operatic clichés, but plays mix-and-match with Wagner's Ring cycle and his opera Tannhaüser . Nevertheless, a perusal of the Wagner Society's publications shows that its members are (to a large extent) huge fans of the cartoon. And trust me, those guys are every bit as obsessive as the most ardent Harry Potter fan (the Ring alone clocks in at around fifteen hours). I write as one about to spend 21 hours (less breaks) of my coming weekend (from Friday lunchtime to Sunday evening) playing Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg , so I think my Wagnerian credentials hold water; and I love the cartoon. I also love Anna Russell's take on the Ring , and so do all the Wagnerians I know.
