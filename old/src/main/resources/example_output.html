  The ancient settlement of <a href="" class="mention loc">Brighthelmstone</a> dates from before <a href="" class="mention">Domesday Book</a> (<a href="" class="mention date">1086</a>), but it emerged as a health resort featuring sea bathing during the <a href="" class="mention date">18th century</a> and became a destination for day-trippers from <a href="" class="mention loc">London</a> after the arrival of the railway in <a href="" class="mention date">1841</a>. <a href="" class="mention loc">Brighton</a> experienced rapid population growth, reaching a peak of over 160,000 by <a href="" class="mention date">1961</a>.[2] Modern <a href="" class="mention loc">Brighton</a> forms part of the <a href="" class="mention loc">Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton</a> conurbation stretching along the coast, with a population of around 480,000.[3]<p/>

  History
  <p/>
  In the <a href="" class="mention">Domesday Book</a>, <a href="" class="mention loc">Brighton</a> was called <a href="" class="mention loc">Bristelmestune</a>[4] and a rent of 4,000 herring was established. In <a href="" class="mention date">June 1514</a> <a href="" class="mention loc">Brighthelmstone</a> was burnt to the ground by French raiders during a war between England and France. Only part of the <a href="" class="mention loc">St Nicholas Church</a> and the street pattern of the area now known as "The Lanes" survived. The first drawing of <a href="" class="mention loc">Brighthelmstone</a> was made in <a href="" class="mention date">1545</a> and depicts what is believed to be the raid of <a href="" class="mention date">1514</a>.[5] During the <a href="" class="mention date">1740s and 1750s</a>, <a href="" class="mention per">Dr Richard Russell</a> of <a href="" class="mention loc">Lewes</a> began prescribing seawater at <a href="" class="mention loc">Brighton</a>.[6][7][8]
  <p/>
  From <a href="" class="mention date">1780</a>, development of the Georgian terraces had started and the fishing village became the fashionable resort of <a href="" class="mention loc">Brighton</a>. Growth of the town was further encouraged by the patronage of the <a href="" class="mention per">Prince Regent</a> (later <a href="" class="mention per">King George IV</a>) after his first visit in <a href="" class="mention date">1783</a>.[9] He spent much of his leisure time in the town and constructed the <a href="" class="mention loc">Royal Pavilion</a> during the early part of his Regency. Although contracted forms of the name are attested since the <a href="" class="mention date">15th Century</a>, it was not until this period that the modern form of the name came into common use.[10]
  <p/>
  The arrival of <a href="" class="mention org">the London and Brighton Railway</a> in <a href="" class="mention date">1841</a> brought <a href="" class="mention loc">Brighton</a> within the reach of day-trippers from <a href="" class="mention loc">London</a> and population growth from around 7,000 in <a href="" class="mention date">1801</a> to over 120,000 by <a href="" class="mention date">1901</a>.[11] Many of the major attractions where built during the Victorian era such as the <a href="" class="mention loc">Grand Hotel</a> (<a href="" class="mention date">1864</a>), the <a href="" class="mention loc">West Pier</a> (<a href="" class="mention date">1866</a>) and the <a href="" class="mention loc">Palace Pier</a> (<a href="" class="mention date">1899</a>). Prior to either of these structures the famous <a href="" class="mention loc">Chain Pier</a> was built, to the designs of <a href="" class="mention per">Captain Samuel Brown</a>. It lasted from <a href="" class="mention date">1823 to 1896</a>, and featured in paintings by both <a href="" class="mention per">Turner</a> and <a href="" class="mention per">Constable</a>.
  <p/>
  After boundary changes between <a href="" class="mention date">1873</a> and <a href="" class="mention date">1952</a>, the land area of <a href="" class="mention loc">Brighton</a> increased from 1,640 acres (7 km2) in <a href="" class="mention date">1854</a> to 14,347 acres (58 km2) in <a href="" class="mention date">1952</a>.[12] New housing estates were established in the acquired areas including <a href="" class="mention loc">Moulsecoomb</a>, <a href="" class="mention loc">Bevendean</a>, <a href="" class="mention loc">Coldean</a> and <a href="" class="mention loc">Whitehawk</a>. The major expansion of <a href="" class="mention date">1928</a> also incorporated the villages of <a href="" class="mention loc">Patcham</a>, <a href="" class="mention loc">Ovingdean</a> and <a href="" class="mention loc">Rottingdean</a>, and much council housing was built in parts of <a href="" class="mention loc">Woodingdean</a> after the <a href="" class="mention misc">Second World War</a>.
  <p/>
  More recently, gentrification of much of Brighton has seen a return of the fashionable image which characterised the growth of the Regency period. Recent housing in the <a href="" class="mention loc">North Laine</a>, for instance, has been designed in keeping with the area.
  In <a href="" class="mention date">1997</a> <a href="" class="mention loc">Brighton and Hove</a> were joined to form the unitary authority of <a href="" class="mention loc">Brighton and Hove</a>, which was granted city status by <a href="" class="mention per">Queen Elizabeth II</a> as part of the millennium celebrations in <a href="" class="mention date">2000</a>.
  <p/>
  <a href="" class="mention loc">Brighton</a> is sometimes referred to as <a href="" class="mention loc">London-by-the-sea</a>.[13][14][15]
